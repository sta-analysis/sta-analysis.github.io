We welcome enquiries from potential research students and visitors who wish to work with our Analysis Group.
Most of our British and European Union PhD students are wholly or partially funded through [EPSRC](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/default.htm) Doctoral Training Grants and School or University studentships are sometimes available.
Outstanding graduates of Scottish universities are eligible for the prestigious [Carnegie Trust](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/) Studentships.
Possible sources of funding for overseas students not holding grants from their home country include:
- [Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan](https://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/)
- [British Chevening Scholarships](https://www.chevening.org/)
- [British Marshall Scholarships](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/)

Applications to all the above grants are made through the School, after the candidate has been offered a place. The group currently has no access to funding for Masters degrees. However, all suitably qualified postgraduate students, including M.Sc. students, are offered the opportunity of supplementing their income by undergraduate tutoring.

For further information about postgraduate study in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, contact [Dr Richard Scott](mailto:maths-dopgr@st-andrews.ac.uk). If you are interested in postgraduate study within the Analysis Research Group you should, at an early stage, contact one of the staff [Prof Kenneth Falconer](mailto:kjf@st-andrews.ac.uk), [Prof Jonathan Fraser](mailto:jmf32@st-andrews.ac.uk), [Prof Lars Olsen](mailto:lo@st-andrews.ac.uk), or [Prof Mike Todd](mailto:m.todd@st-andrews.ac.uk).
