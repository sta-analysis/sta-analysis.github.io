Every summer we arrange internships lasting around 6 weeks for a number of undergraduates, both from St Andrews and other universities, who are thinking about doing a PhD in mathematics. Interested students should contact [Dr Richard Scott](mailto:rks4@st-andrews.ac.uk).
There are various funding opportunities available, including:
- [The Laidlaw Leadership and Research Programme](https://laidlaw.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/)
- [Carnegie Trust Vacation Scholarships](https://www.carnegie-trust.org/award-schemes/vacation-scholarships/)
- [LMS Undergraduate Research Bursaries](https://www.lms.ac.uk/grants/undergraduate-research-bursaries)
