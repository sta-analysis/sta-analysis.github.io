There is a strong tradition for Analysis at St Andrews, notably in the mid 20th century under the leadership of Professors Turnbull and Copson. The present Analysis Group was established in the mid-1990s with the appointment of Kenneth Falconer followed by Lars Olsen and Bernd Stratmann. Mike Todd was appointed in 2011, followed by Jonathan Fraser in 2016, and Natalia Jurga in 2023. The Group has successfully cultivated an exciting and vibrant environment: recruitment of postgraduate students is flourishing, and the research output of the Group is novel and exciting, with several new strands of research being developed.

The group's interests include:
- Geometric Measure Theory and Fractal Geometry
- Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory
- Thermodynamic Formalism
- Multifractal Geometry
- Stochastic Processes
- Group Actions
- Hyperbolic Geometry
- Fourier Analysis
- Metric Number Theory
- Differential Equations on Fractals
