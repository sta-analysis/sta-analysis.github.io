There is a natural bijection between the set of infinite zero-one 
sequences (points of the Cantor set) and the set of sum-free subsets of 
the natural numbers. This bijection allows us to transfer notions such 
as measure and Baire category to the set of sum-free sets, and we can 
ask "What does the typical sum-free set look like?". This is a situation 
in which measure and category give completely different answers. A 
residual set of sum-free sets are "sf-universal", but this property has 
probability 0, while as a measure space the set has a very intricate 
structure. A recent paper of Haviv and Levy throws a little more light 
on this, but many interesting problems remain.
