Falconer followedby the young and motivating researchers L. Olsen and B. Stratmann. TheGroup has successfully  consolidated itself over the past 10 years andcreated an exciting and vibrant environment: recruitment of postgraduatestudents is flourishing, currently with 8 research students, and theresearch output of the Group is novel and exciting, with several newstrands of research being developed. The School plan envisages that afurther young member of staff will be appointed very soon.<P>The group's main interests are:<P><table width=100% border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><ul><li>Geometric Measure Theory and Fractal Geometry.<P><li>Dynamics and Ergodic Theory.<P><li>Multifractal Geometry.<P><li>Kleinian Groups.<P><li>Metric Number Theory.<td><ul> <li>Stochastic Processes.<P><li>Noncommutative Fractal Geometry.<P><li>Thermodynamical Forlism within Noncommutative Geometry.<P><li>Group Theory and Fractals.<P><li>Differential Equations on Fractals.</ul></table><P></body></html>
