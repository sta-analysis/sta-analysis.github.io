We describe a family of groups acting on Julia sets for certain quadratic polynomials. These groups are similar to the Thompson groups F, T, and V, and act as piecewise-conformal homeomorphisms of the associated Julia set.  We will discuss how the group depends on the self-similar structure of the Julia set, and we will examine the properties of the resulting group for several different points in the Mandelbrot set.
