Devil's staircases can be defined as the cumulative distribution functions of finite measures supported on fractals with Lebesgue measure zero. I will discuss some results concerning the existence of H&oumllder derivatives on devil's staircases given by self-similar and self-conformal constructions and their link to multifractal spectra.
