Powers of the Poisson kernels have been around since at least the 60's. They are obtained by
taking as kernel in an integral operator powers of the Poisson kernel instead of the Poisson kernel
itself and are, among other things, eigenfunctions for the hyperbolic Laplacian in the standard
hyperbolic models of the unit disc or upper half plane, with eigenvalues which depend on the
power.

For powers not equal to one, the convergence toward boundary values is a bit different than the
usual Poisson integrals. It was seen that the convergence regions were wider than nontangential
regions, In the end 80's-beginning 90's, it was noticed that for the square root of the Poisson
kernel even more was true: the convergence regions increased when you took boundary values in
<i>L<sup>p</sup></i>
spaces with higher exponents.

This talk will give a short review of convergence results for square roots of Poisson kernels (the
past) and also present some open questions regarding the size of exceptional sets for the convergence which have been investigated for Poisson integrals by many people but seems to be not
have been considered for the square root of the Poisson kernel, and which the speaker himself find
interested (future, or at least a little part of it).
