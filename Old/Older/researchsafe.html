Continuing work, partly in collaboration withmathematicians from Helsinki and Jyvaskyla, includes the geometry ofHausdorff and packing measures, including sections and projections offractals and the analysis of self-affine sets and measures. <br><br><li><strong>Dynamics and Ergodic Theory</strong> - Falconer, Olsen and Stratmann<br><br>Although the ergodic theorem guarantees that ergodic averages converge toan almost sure limit, the sets where the upper and lower limits takespecific different values can also be large. Olsen has introduced powerfultechniques allowing analysis of such sets of 'divergence ponts'. <br><br><li><strong>Multifractal Geometry</strong> - Falconer, Olsen and Stratmann<br><br>The measure theoretic multifractal formalism introduced in the 1990s byOlsen is now standard in rigorous multifractal analysis and has been usedin many questions involving analysis of measures. Topics studied from amultifractal viewpoint include self-affine measures, limit sets ofKelinian groups, divergence points, points of non-differentiability offunctions and inhomogeneous measures.<br><br><li><strong>Kleinian groups</strong> - Stratmann<br><br>This work, partly supported by an EPSRC grant, involving collaborationswith Denton and Gottingen, has concentrated on the behaviour of geodesicson hyperbolic manifolds and the structure and dimension properties oflimit sets on Kleinian groups, relating to problems of ergodic theory,Diophantine analysis and growth rates. Recently Kessebšhmer and Stratmannhave investigated boundary aspects of the first homology group for finitecoverings of the modular surface and obtained a remarkable multifractaldescription of Manin-Marcolli's limiting modular symbols.<br><br><li><strong>Metric Number theory</strong> - Olsen, McCabe and Stratmann<br><br>The Group has worked on many aspects of metrical Diophantineapproximation, the structure of the Liouville numbers and metricproperties of continued fractions. Olsen and collaborators have studiedtopological and metric properties of non-normal numbers.<br><br><li><strong>Stochastic processes</strong> - Falconer<br><br>Gaussian and stable processes are used increasingly to model highlyirregular phenomena.  Work here includes the study of local properties ofsuch processes, which has demonstrated the ubiquity of the fractional andmultifractional Brownian motions.  Joint work with Fernandez has developedlikelihood methods for McMC inference to fit such stochastic models tovery large data sets. Collaborations on fractal stochastic processes withFrench institutions (Orsay, INRIA, Clermont-Ferrand) have let to theintroduction of 'multistable' processes which promise to be widelyapplicable.<br><br><li><strong>Noncommutative Fractal Geometry</strong> - Olsen and Stratmann<br><br>Stratmann and Marc Kessebohmer (<a href="http://katmat.math.uni-bremen.de/"> Bremen University) </a> have obtained relations between KMS states onCuntz-Krieger algebras and the dual of Perron-Frobenius operators for ageneral (non-hyperbolic) class of systems. Current work is developingspectral triples for fractal spaces and on noncommutative versions of thethermodynamic formalism.<br><br><li><strong>Group Theory and Fractals</strong> - Falconer<br><br>A novel group-theoretic approach was introduced (jointly with O'Connorfrom the Algebra Group) to analyse the symmetry structure of classes offractal. The fractal geometry of subgroups of the automorphism groups ofinfinite trees is also starting to be fruitful.<br><br><li><strong>Differential equations on fractals</strong> - Falconer<br><br>A program started with J Hu (research student) studies nonlinear diffusionprocesses and PDEs on fractal domains, with an emphasis on the interplaybetween the various dimensions of the domain and the critical parametersfor the behaviour of solutions.<br></ul><P></body></html>
