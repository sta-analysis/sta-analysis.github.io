<P>

We welcome enquiries from potential research students and visitors who wish 
to work with our Analysis Group.  Most of our British and European Union PhD students are wholly or 
partially funded through <A 
HREF="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/default.htm">EPSRC</A> Doctoral Training 
Grants and  School or University  studentships are sometimes available.
Outstanding graduates of Scottish universities are eligible for the
prestigious  <A HREF="http://www.carnegie-trust.org/">Carnegie Trust</A> 
Studentships. Possible sources of funding for overseas students not holding grants
from their home country include:

<ul>

<LI>
<A HREF="http://cscuk.dfid.gov.uk/">Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan</A> 
<P>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.chevening.org/">British Chevening Scholarships</A> 
<P>
<LI>
<A HREF="http://www.marshallscholarship.org/">British Marshall
Scholarships</A> 
</UL>

Applications to all the above grants are made through the School, after
the candidate has been offered a place.  The group currently has no access to funding for Masters degrees. However,
all suitably qualified postgraduate students, including M.Sc. students, are offered the
opportunity of supplementing their income by undergraduate tutoring. 
<P>
