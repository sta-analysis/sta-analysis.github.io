If an iterated function systems (IFS) has a countably infinite number of contractions, the Hausdorff and box dimensions of the limit set can differ, even when the contractions are conformal maps. The intermediate dimensions are a family of dimensions which lie between the Hausdorff and box dimensions, and we will discuss some results on the Hausdorff, box and intermediate dimensions of limit sets of infinite iterated function systems. We will show that much better information can be obtained if the contractions are conformal, and we consider applications to sets of irrational numbers whose continued fraction expansions have restricted digits. We will explain that for 'generic' infinite IFSs the box dimension of the limit set (unlike the Hausdorff dimension) equals the ambient spatial dimension. Based on joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
