The upper regularity dimension of a measure can be thought of as the Assouad dimension of a measure and follows naturally from the measure theoretic definition of Assouad dimension. We will discuss how the upper regularity dimension interacts with other well known definitions of dimension such as the local dimension, providing examples along the way. There is also an interesting relation between this dimension and the doubling property, which we will use to generalise a well known result about tangent measures to weak tangent measures.  This is joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
