The Hausdorff measure (and Hausdorff dimension) tells us the exponential scaling behaviour of efficient covers of sets. For some sets the scaling is however not exactly captured by an exponential function and a generalisation of the Hausdorff measure to arbitrary gauge functions can give us more information. In this talk I will introduce the more general Hausdorff measure and apply it to the setting of random sets.
