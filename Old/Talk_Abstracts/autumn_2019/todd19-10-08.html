Lots of mathematical questions can be interpreted as "if this sequence of objects converges, do certain associated qualities of those
objects converge?". In this talk the objects will be measures associated to a dynamical system and the quality will be entropy.
When a system is non-compact, then mass can escape in the limit: here we'll consider how entropy can converge "modulo escape
of mass". This is joint work with Godofredo Iommi and Anibal Velozo.
