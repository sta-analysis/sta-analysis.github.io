Projections have received sustained interest since Marstrand's seminal result in 1954 on the Hausdorff dimension of projections in the plane. To begin, we will introduce key developments from 1954 to the present day. This aims to provide context and motivation to recent results on the intermediate dimensions of projections. To conclude, some rather surprising corollaries on the Hausdorff and box dimensions of projections will be discussed. The talk will presume little prior knowledge, and so will be accessible even if you are unfamiliar with many of the concepts above.
