We study several distinct notions of average distances between points
belonging to graph-directed self-similar subsets of  the real line.
In particular,  we compute the average distance with respect to
graph-directed self-similar measures, and with respect to the normalised Hausdorff measure.

Our result have several application.. For example, if  T denotes the set of those real numbers x in the unit
interval for which any 3 consecutive binary digits x sum up to at least 2 (so T is the celebrated Drobot-Turner set),
then the average distance between two randomly chosen points in T equals

( 4444&lambda;<sup>2</sup> +  2071&lambda;  +  3030  ) /  (12141&lambda;<sup>2</sup>  +  5650&lambda;  +  8281)   =  0.36610656...,

where &lambda; is the unique positive real number such that  &lambda;<sup>3</sup>  -  &lambda;<sup>2</sup>  -  1 = 0..
