We show, by adapting a dynamical argument of Lehnert and Schweitzer involving actions on Cantor space, that an apparent broadening of the class of known CoCF groups (a class of groups defined by some formal language criteria) actually adds no new groups to the class, once more producing a result in line with Lehnert's Conjecture.  Joint with Jim Belk and Francesco Matucci.
