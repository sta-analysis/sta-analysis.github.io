We'll introduce and talk about recent and past results on the upper box dimension of inhomogeneous attractors generated from iterated functions systems.
This has applications for affine systems with affinity dimension less than one and systems satisfying bounded distortion, such as conformal systems in dimensions greater than one. 
In particular, this generalises the result of Fraser on self-similar sets. We also apply the methods developed to investigate the Hausdorff measure at the critical value.
