In this talk we will present a precise formula for the &theta;-intermediate dimensions of all Bedford-McMullen carpets for the whole spectrum of &theta;. We will explain with the aid of some pictures that the graph of the intermediate dimensions has an interesting form not seen in previous examples. We describe an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis, and as an application of our results, we give a necessary condition for two Bedford-McMullen carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres to be bi-Lipschitz equivalent. This is joint work with Istvan Kolossvary.
