Given a fixed subset of hyperbolic space and a Kleinian group acting on that space, the orbital set is the orbit of the given set under the group.  When the given set is compact, I will compute the upper box dimensions of the orbital set in terms of the dimensions of the given set and of the limit set of the Kleinian group.  There is a connection here with the dimension theory of inhomogeneous self-similar sets, for example.  When the given set is not compact, I will construct examples to show that different things can happen.  This is joint work with Tom Bartlett.
