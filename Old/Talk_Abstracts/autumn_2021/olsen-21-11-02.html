Tube formulas give the volume of the set of all points within the distance <i>r</i> of a (compact) subset of Euclidean space for <i>r</i> > 0, and play an instrumental role in the study of geometric measure theory (e.g. the box dimension can be defined in this way). Recently, very precise tube formulas for self-similar sets satisfying the Open Set Condition (OSC) have attracted considerable interest. In this talk we will study multifractal tube formulas of self-similar sets and self-similar measures satisfying the OSC.
