Kaufman proved that sets of well-approximable numbers on the real line are Salem. A natural question to ask is whether or not the same thing holds in higher dimensions as well. That is, whether or not this Kaufman's result is just a special case (in &#8477;) of a general phenomenon (in &#8477;<sup><i>n</i></sup>). In this talk, I present a recent result which tells us that Kaufman's result is in fact very special. In higher dimensions, sets of well approximable vectors (suitably defined) are in general not Salem. This is joint work with Kyle Hambrook (San Jose State University).
