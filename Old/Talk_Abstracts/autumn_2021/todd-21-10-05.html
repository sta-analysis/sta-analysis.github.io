I'll explain how point processes can be used to understand extreme values in a dynamical system.  These processes can zoom in on the parts of a dynamical orbit where 'extreme events' occur and asymptotically converge as we look deeper into the orbit: if the system is 'mixing enough' they converge to a form of Poisson process.  They can capture structure in the extreme events and tell us, for example, about record times and record values for our system.
