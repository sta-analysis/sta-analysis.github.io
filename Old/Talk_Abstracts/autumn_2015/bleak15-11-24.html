A recent paper of E. Breuillard, M. Kalantar, M. Kennedy, and N. Ozawa give new conditions on a group, so that if the group satisfies these conditions, then the (reduced) C* algebra of the group is simple.  Other work of Haagerup and Olesen shows that if either of the (reduced) C* algebras of R. Thompson's groups F or T is simple, then R. Thompson's group F is non-amenable.  We explore some of the conditions of Breuillard et.al. in this context.
