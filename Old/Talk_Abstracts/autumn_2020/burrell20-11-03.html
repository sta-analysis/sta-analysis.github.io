Spirals are exciting objects that spring up throughout nature and mathematics. They arise in turbulent dynamical systems and play an important role in the theory of conformal welding. We introduce elliptical polynomial spirals, a flexible family of planar spirals with differing polynomial rates of decay in the two-axis directions. After setting the scene, we present the various dimensions of these spirals and probe the way they differ via the emerging field of dimension interpolation. Then, we consider the regularity of H&#246;lder maps that deform one spiral into another. Dimension yields an initial bound on the H&#246;lder exponent, which, surprisingly, may be improved upon by analysing the images of spirals under fractional Brownian motion.

This is based on joint work with Kenneth Falconer and Jonathan Fraser.
