The fine multifractal spectrum of a measure in Euclidean space describes, in some sense, how singular the measure is with respect to Lebesgue measure. A heuristic relationship known as the multifractal formalism states that the fine multifractal spectrum is given by the concave conjugate of the <i>L<sup>q</sup></i>-spectrum of the measure. I will discuss this phenomenon for self-similar iterated function systems in the real line satisfying the weak separation condition, where the multifractal formalism is known not to hold in general.

The main tool I will introduce is a new symbolic encoding of the self-similar set using a weighted directed graph construction, where associated self-similar measures are described by products of non-negative matrices associated with the edges in the graph. A key insight is that, under the weak separation condition, the multifractal formalism is partially characterized by certain properties of the graph itself.
