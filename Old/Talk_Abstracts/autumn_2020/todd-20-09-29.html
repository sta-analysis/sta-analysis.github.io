For a sequence of real-valued random variables <i>X</i><sub>1</sub>, ..., <i>X<sub>n</sub></i> we think of an extreme event as some <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> exceeding some threshold.  Choosing thresholds carefully w.r.t. <i>n</i>, and rescaling time, one can often derive interesting limits which can be represented as Poisson Point Processes or L&#233;vy processes.  However, if exceedances come in clusters, as many natural extreme events do, then the usual machinery can break down.  Here I'll explain how this theory can be applied to dynamical systems and how to extend the theory to deal with clustering.  This is joint work with Ana Cristina Freitas and Jorge Freitas (Porto).
