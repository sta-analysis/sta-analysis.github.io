We study the box dimensions of sets which are invariant under the toral endormorphism (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) &#8614; (<i>mx</i> mod 1, <i>ny</i> mod 1) for integers <i>n</i>><i>m</i> &#8805; 2. This is a fundamental example of an expanding, nonconformal dynamical system, and invariant sets have many subtle properties. The basic examples of such invariant sets are Bedford-McMullen carpets and, more generally, invariant sets are modelled by subshifts on the associated symbolic space. When this subshift is topologically mixing and sofic, the situation is well-understood by results of Kenyon and Peres, in particular the box dimension satisfies a natural formula in terms of entropy and the expansion coefficients <i>m</i>,<i>n</i>.  In this talk we will discuss recent results with Jonathan Fraser on what happens beyond the sofic and mixing case.
