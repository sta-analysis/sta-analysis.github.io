The Borel hierarchy provides a natural classification of the “complexity” of subsets of a metric space.
Loosely speaking, for each ordinal gamma, the  so-called Pi_{gamma}^0-complete sets are the most complex sets forming
the building blocks from which all other Pi_{gamma}^0 sets can be build.

The talk will analyse sets known as “multifractal decomposition sets” from this viewpoint.

For example, as an application of our results we show that the classical
Eggleston-Besicovitch set is Pi_{2}^{0}-complete.
