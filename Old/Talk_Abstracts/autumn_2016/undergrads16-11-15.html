J Hyde et al proved that, for a typical uniformly continuous function on a bounded subset of the real numbers, the lower box dimension of its graph is as small as possible and the upper box dimension is as large as possible. A natural question to ask now is whether or not it is possible to ‘smooth’ out this erratic behaviour by taking averages of the box counting function. It transpires that in fact no such ‘smoothing’ is possible using general averaging methods, and indeed the nth order average box dimensions of a typical continuous function are as different as possible. This talk is based on joint work between B Adam-Day, C. Ashcroft, A.Mitchell, L. Olsen, C. O’Connor, N. Pinzani, A. Rizzoli, and J. Rowe.
