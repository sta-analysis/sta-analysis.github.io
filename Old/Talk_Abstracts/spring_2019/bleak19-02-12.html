This talk will feature joint work with Daniel Lanoue on the finitely presented infinite simple Brin-Thompson groups nV.  In Brin's introductory paper in 2004, he introduces the groups nV (for positive integers n); a new family of infinite, simple, finitely presented groups modelled on R Thompson's group V = 1V.  In the paper, he was able to show that 1V was not isomorphic to 2V, but for larger n, the isomorphism/non-isomorphism question remained unclear.  We showed (circa 2007) that a simple dynamical invariant (still measured by groups!) is able to separate all of these groups from each other.
