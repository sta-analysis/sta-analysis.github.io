It is known that fractional integrals and the classical fractional maximal function are smoothing operators, in the sense that they map Lebesgue spaces into first order Sobolev spaces. We will show that this phenomenon continues to hold for the fractional spherical maximal function when the dimension of the ambient space is greater than or equal to 5. Moreover, we will discuss the known and open questions regarding the derivative of the Hardy--Littlewood maximal function and its fractional counterpart. This is joint work with Joao P. G. Ramos and Olli Saari.
