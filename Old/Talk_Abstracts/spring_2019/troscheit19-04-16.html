The lower Assouad dimension of a measure (also known as the lower regularity dimension) quantifies the "inverse doubling" of a measure. In this talk we investigate the regularity of measures from this perspective and show that many natural measures have positive lower Assouad dimension, i.e. are inverse doubling. This is in stark contrast to the doubling property: measures are generically far from doubling.
We will relate this property to L^p-improving measures, a class of measures that improve the regularity of (other) measures on convolution.
