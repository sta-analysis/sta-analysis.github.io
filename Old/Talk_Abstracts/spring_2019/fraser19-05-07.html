A 2017 result of Andr&aacute;s M&aacute;th&eacute;  states that, given any degree d polynomial p : R<sup>nv</sup> &rarr; R with rational coefficients, there is a subset E &sub; R<sup>n</sup> of Hausdorff dimension n/d that does not contain any v distinct points x<sub>1</sub>, ... , x<sub>v</sub> such that p(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>v</sub>) = 0. We discuss a version of this result that applies when the coefficients of p are assumed only to be algebraic over the rational numbers.
