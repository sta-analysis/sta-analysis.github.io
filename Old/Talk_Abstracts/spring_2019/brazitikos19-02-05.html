The classical Loomis-Whitney inequality and the uniform cover inequality of Bollob´as and Thomason provide upper bounds for the volume of a compact set in terms of its lower dimensional coordinate projections. We provide further extensions of these inequalities in the setting of convex bodies. We also establish the corresponding dual inequalities for coordinate sections; these uniform cover inequalities for sections may be viewed as extensions of Meyer's dual Loomis-Whitney inequality.
