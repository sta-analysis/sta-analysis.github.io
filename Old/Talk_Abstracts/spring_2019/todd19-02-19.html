For compact dynamical systems, entropy is usually upper semi-continuous: i.e., for a convergent sequence of invariant measures the entropy may jump up in the limit, but it can't jump down.  I'll give an idea of why this should be true and then consider the case of non-compact shift maps, where we can prove the same result.  The main idea is to transfer the problem to loop graphs and loop systems, which can then be embedded into a compact shift.  This is joint work with Godofredo Iommi and An&iacute;bal Velozo.
