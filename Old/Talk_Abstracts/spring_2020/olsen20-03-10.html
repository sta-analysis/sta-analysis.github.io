As an example we consider discrete Besicovitch-Eggleston
subsets of the positive integers &#8469; based on the frequencies
of digits in the N-ary expansion of positive integers, and show that
the "fractional" dimensions of these sets satisfy a formula analogous
to the classical Besicovitch-Eggleston dimension formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of the usual Besicovitch-Eggleston subsets of &#8477;.
