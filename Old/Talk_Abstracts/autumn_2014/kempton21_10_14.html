Despite twenty five years of progress in understanding dimensions of self-affine sets, the question 'does box dimension exist for self-affine sets' remains open. In this talk I will explain how I am attempting to approach the problem.
We begin by studying the basic dynamics associated with projections of self-affine sets, and in particular how projections of self-affine sets in different directions are related.
This allows us to introduce a related family of trees. We will explain why studying the thermodynamic formalism for these trees ought to resolve the conjecture for some significant special cases.
