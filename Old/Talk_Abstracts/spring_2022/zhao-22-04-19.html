Given a dynamical system on a compact metric space, one can investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the shortest distance between the first n iterates of any pair of distinct points (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) in the space; under the assumptions of fast decay of correlations and uniform upper bound for ball sizes, Rousseau, Barros and Liao (2019) gave a quantitative result using correlation dimension inspired by Renyi entropy. Similar techniques may also be applied to analyse the behaviour of the shortest distance within the orbit of a single point in the phase space, while taking into account the measure of points with rapid returns via Renyi entropy function.
