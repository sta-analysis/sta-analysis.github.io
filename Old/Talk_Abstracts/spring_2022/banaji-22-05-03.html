If an iterated function system consists of a countably infinite number of contractions then the Hausdorff, box and Assouad dimensions of the limit set can all differ, even if the contractions are assumed to be conformal and well-separated. We will explain what is known about the dimension theory of these limit sets, paying particular attention to the Assouad spectrum, which is a family of dimensions lying between box and Assouad dimension. We present bounds for the Assouad spectrum which are sharp in general. The Assouad spectrum of the class of examples which we use to show that these bounds are sharp can display interesting behaviour, such as having two phase transitions. This is based on joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
