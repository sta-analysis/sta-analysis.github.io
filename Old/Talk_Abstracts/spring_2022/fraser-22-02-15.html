A Kakeya set is a (compact) set in &Ropf;<sup><i>d</i></sup> containing a unit line segment in all possible directions.  The famous Kakeya conjecture (open for <i>d</i>>2) is that Kakeya sets must have Hausdorff dimension <i>d</i>.  I will discuss recent joint work with Harris and Kroon related to this problem.
