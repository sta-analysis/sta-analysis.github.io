Thurston's theorem in complex dynamics implies that every finite-sheeted branched cover of the complex plane by itself whose ramification points are periodic can be deformed to polynomial with periodic critical points.  Hubbard's famous twisted rabbit problem -- first solved by Bartholdi and Nekrashevych using iterated monodromy groups -- asks for an algorithm to find this polynomial from the branched cover.  In this talk I will discuss a new solution to the twisted rabbit problem based on the geometry of trees in the complex plane.  This is joint work with Justin Lanier, Dan Margalit, and Rebecca Winarski.
