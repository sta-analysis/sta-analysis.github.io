The intermediate dimensions, introduced by Falconer, Fraser and Kempton, are a family of dimensions which lie between the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions, parameterised by &#952; &#8712; [0,1]. I will summarise some of the properties of the intermediate dimensions and introduce a generalisation of them which gives finer geometric information about sets for which the intermediate dimensions are discontinuous at &#952; = 0.
