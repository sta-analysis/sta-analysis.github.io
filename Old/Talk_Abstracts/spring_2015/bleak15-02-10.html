We study the set of automorphisms of the family of Higman groups \({G_{n,r}}\).  In particular, we show that any automorphism of a Higman group will have a locally constant Radon-Nikodym derivative, and we apply this knowledge to other descriptions we have about these automorphisms. Joint with Yonah Maissel and Andres Navas.
