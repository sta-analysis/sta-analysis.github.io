Recently, the article "On the Assouad dimension of self-similar sets with overlaps" by J. M. Fraser, A. M. Henderson, E. J. Olson and J. C. Robinson gave an interesting dichotomy. They showed that for nontrivial self-similar subsets of the real line; satisfying the weak separation property (WSP) means the Assouad dimension is same as the Hausdorff dimension, and not satisfying WSP means its Assouad dimension is 1. We would like to generalise this result to self-conformal systems. The project is still work in progress, but some results have already been obtained. I am going to talk about the current results and the ideas we have about continuing the project.
