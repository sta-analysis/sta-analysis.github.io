Last week we saw a beautiful proof of Roth's Theorem using graphs. This week we will discuss Furstenberg's proof of Szemeredi's Theorem, the generalizations of Roth's Theorem. The proof relies simply on the Uniform Furstenberg multiple recurrence theorem which we will spend some time explaining then show how it is equivalent to Szemeredi's Theorem. If time permits afterwards we will discuss some of the further generalisations that the multiple recurrence theorem can be used to prove.
