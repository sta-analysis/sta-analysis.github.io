In a vector space over the field with 3 elements, a 3-term arithmetic progression is an affine line; a cap-set (or, to finite geometers, a cap) is a set containing no affine line. How large can such a set be? There are trivial upper and lower bounds of 3^n and 2^n (the latter from the set of points with all coordinates 0 and 1); until last year, the best known upper bound was c.3^n/n by Roy Meshulam. Then Ellenberg and Gijswijt independently improved this to roughly 2.756^n, using a lemma of Croot, Lev and Pach. I will give the proof of this result.
