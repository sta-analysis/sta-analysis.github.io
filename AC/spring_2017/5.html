The study of self similar set dates back to 1883 AD, when the ancient Europeans figured out some beautiful but evil structures can be summoned with the spell of self similarity. As the ancient kid's nursery rhyme says: 'They can be large AND small, they can be few AND a lot.' Later smart ancient people came up with a powerful tool to attack those structures that has been summoned, known as 'THE dimension'. It became popular around all cultures and depends on the culture, they had different versions 'Hausdorff, box, assouad...'. This attack was successful, however there were still a bit of cloud--The self similar set with overlaps. This week, we shall see a recent progress on dimension of self similar set with overlaps by Mike Hochman.
