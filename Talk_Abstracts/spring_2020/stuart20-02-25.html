The dimension theory regarding limit sets of geometrically finite Kleinian groups has a long history, dating back to work from Patterson in 1976 regarding the Hausdorff dimension, to Stratmann and Urbanski's work in 1996 on the box dimension, to more recent work done by Fraser regarding the Assouad dimension. I will discuss some recent work regarding the Assouad spectrum of these limit sets. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
