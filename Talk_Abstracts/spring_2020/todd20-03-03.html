Given a dynamical system f and two points x and y, a natural question is: given a time n what is the minimal distance between the n-orbits of x and y?  (I.e. the smallest distance between the set {x, f(x),..., f<sup>n-1</sup>(x)} and {y, f(y),..., f<sup>n-1</sup>(y)}).  It turns out that this can be written in terms of the correlation dimension of the measure at hand.  This dimension is poorly understood for all except very simple cases, but I'll present some examples of interesting slowly mixing cases where it can be computed and this orbit approach problem solved.  This is joint work with Jerome Rousseau (Bahia/Porto).
