One can note that sumsets and difference sets are somewhat similar in structure. It is therefore interesting to use some ideas from the study of sumsets to get new bounds on the dimensions of distance sets. We obtain bounds on the Assouad and upper box dimension of the distance set of F with respect to the respective dimension of F which improve our knowledge for sets of small dimension. I will make these bounds precise and then explain how previous work on sumsets can be used to int the proofs. This is joint work with Jon and Han.
