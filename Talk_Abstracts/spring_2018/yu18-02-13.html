In this talk we discuss a variant of the Kakeya problem. Let us consider a set in the plane whose difference set contains the unit circle. How large is this set in terms of the Hausdorff dimension, box dimensions and the Assouad dimension? It is known that the Hausdorff dimension of such set can be 0 and the lower box dimension must be at least 0.5. In this talk we will discuss some further results and at the same time we will have a lot of fun in discrete geometry.
