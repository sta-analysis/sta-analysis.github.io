In this talk I will briefly describe a construction of box-like self-affine sets, due to Fraser.
Randomising this construction will serve as motivation to study a different, more abstract, construction of random self-similar graph directed attractors (RGDA). The RGDA considered in this talk are different to the classical concept of random graph directed attractors and we will briefly highlight how to start tackling the problem of proving that the Hausdorff dimension coincides with the box counting dimension for these attractors, independent of overlap. The basic ideas behind the proof are simple, complicated by an intricate use of branching processes, modelling the relevant properties of our attractor by random forests (collection of trees).
