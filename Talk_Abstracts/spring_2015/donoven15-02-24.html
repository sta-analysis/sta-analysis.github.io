I will be discussing the paper `Topological spaces admitting a unique fractal structure' by Christoph Bandt and Teklehaimanot Retta.  This paper examines a topological description of self-similar sets with controlable overlaps and in particular shows that some fractals, such as the Siepinski gasket, have a finite group of homeomorphisms.
