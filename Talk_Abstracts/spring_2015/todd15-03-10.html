I'll discuss random dynamical systems (these will be shifts on some alphabet with some random Gibbs measures) and their recurrence properties.  In particular, I'll explain how quenched asymptotic hitting time distributions can be obtained (annealed distributions follow naturally).  In the shift setting, we solve this problem completely.  This is ongoing joint work with Jerome Rousseau (Bahia).
