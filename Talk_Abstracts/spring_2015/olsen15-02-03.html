We play darts by throwing darts on the Cartor set and ask the following question:
What is the average distance between two randomly thrown darts on the Cantor set?

We will also consider higher order average moments. In particular, (using techniques from zeta-functions)
we will investigate the asymptotic behaviour of higher order average moments of self-similar measures on Cantor sets.

This is joint work with Allen (York), Edwards (Edinburgh) and Harper (St Andrews).
