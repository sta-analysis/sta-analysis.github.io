Given irrational numbers a,b and a sequence S over digits a,b, we can construct an orbit by adding a or b in each step according to the sequence S. It is proven by Katznelson that the closure of such an orbit can have zero Hausdorff dimension. On the other hand, it is also known that such an orbit must have lower box dimension at least 1/2. We will discuss some further results, related problems as well as how they are related to the affine embedding problem between self-similar sets.
