We will briefly introduce the Assouad and lower dimensions for those who have never seen them before, providing a brief history of the notions. Then we will discuss self-affine sponges, a natural generalization of Bedford-McMullen carpets. Finally for the second half of the talk we calculate the Assouad dimension of these sponges, work done recently with Fraser.
