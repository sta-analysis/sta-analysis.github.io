The talk will be a gentle and well-illustrated introduction to certain random processes that exhibit ‘jumps’. We will introduce stable distributions and then use random point sets in the plane to define \alpha-stable and multistable processes. The talk will end with a brief outline on recent work on self-stabilising processes.
