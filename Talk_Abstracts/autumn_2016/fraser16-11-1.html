The Assouad dimension is a familiar notion of dimension which, for a given metric space, returns the minimal exponent <em>\(\alpha\) <TD>&isin;</TD></em> 0 such that for 
any pair of scales <em>0 &lt; r &lt; R</em>, any ball of radius <em>R</em> may be covered by a constant times <em>(R/r)<sup>\(\alpha\)</sup></em> balls of radius <em>r</em>.  We introduce a spectrum 
of dimensions, motivated by the Assouad dimension, designed to get more information about the scaling structure of the space. More precisely, 
to each <em>\(\theta\) <TD>&isin;</TD> (0,1)</em>, we associate the appropriate analogue of the Assouad dimension with the restriction that the two scales <em>r</em> and <em>R </em>
used in the definition satisfy <em>log R/ log r=\(\theta\)</em>.  We conduct a detailed study of the resulting `dimension spectrum' (as a function of 
<em>\(\theta\)</em>) including its basic analytic and geometric properties as well as the precise calculation of the spectrum for some specific examples.
