We give a finite set of (combinatorial) conditions under which a broad class of finitely generated subgroups of the group of homeomorphisms of the unit interval is determined up to isomorphism.  These conditions are stable under raising the generators to powers, so that the subgroups generated by high-power replacements of the original generators will be isomorphic to the original groups, and these isomorphisms will be witnessed by topological semi-conjugacies.  We then use these conditions to highlight a discussion of the elementary amenable subgroups of the group PL_+(I) of orientation preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval, mentioning results which provide new examples of elementary amenable (EA) subgroups of R. Thompson’s group F, which are of EA class of unprecedented complexity.
