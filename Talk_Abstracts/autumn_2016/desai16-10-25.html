The Swift-Hohenberg equation<br>
<em>u<sub>t</sub>=-(1+<TD> &part;</TD><sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> u - \(\mu\) u  + \(\nu\)  u <sup>2</sup> - u<sup>3</sup>, x ∈ R</em>
<br>
is an example of a pattern-forming dynamical system. Previous work, which focused on localised roll patterns in the Swift-Hohenberg equation, involved the study of orientable invariant manifolds. Here we will look at more general systems which exhibit localised rolls with non-orientable invariant manifolds; more specifically, we will investigate the effect this has on the characteristic snaking behaviour of the bifurcation diagrams and on the types of solutions produced.

In this talk, I will discuss the results obtained when considering the non-orientable case and, more generally, when looking at twisted manifolds. This is joint work with Tarik Aougab, Margaret Beck, Paul Carter, Bj ̈orn Sandstede, Melissa Stadt and Aric Wheeler.
