This talk will discuss the position of the so-called "multifractal decomposition sets" in the Baire Hierarchy. In particular, we will prove that "multifractal decomposition sets" are the building blocks from which all other &Pi;<sub>&gamma;</sub><sup>0</sup>-sets can be constructed; more, precisely, "multifractal decomposition sets" are &Pi;<sub>&gamma;</sub><sup>0</sup>-complete.

As an application we find the position of the classical Eggleston-Besicovitch set in the Baire Hierarchy.
