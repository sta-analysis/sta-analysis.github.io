The intermediate dimensions of a set are a family of dimensions, indexed on [0,1], which lie between the Hausdorff and box dimensions of the set. A recent result (joint with Amlan Banaji) shows that a function can be the intermediate dimensions of some set in &Ropf;<sup><i>d</i></sup> if and only if the function satisfies certain local derivative constraints. In this talk, I will provide some intuition behind this result. Then, if time permits, I will describe the construction of sets with prescribed intermediate dimensions.
