In this talk we will consider spherical maximal operators in two and higher dimensions with a supremum taken over a given dilation set. It turns out that the sharp <i>L<sup>p</sup></i> improving properties of such operators are closely related to fractal dimensions of the dilation set such as the Minkowski and Assouad dimensions. At the center of the talk will be a simple characterization of the closed convex sets which can occur as closure of the sharp <i>L<sup>p</sup></i> improving region of such a maximal operator. This is joint work with Andreas Seeger. Time permitting, we will also discuss some ongoing work and further directions.
