A class of self-affine sponges generated by diagonal matrices is introduced which generalise well-known planar constructions to higher dimensions. We derive upper and lower bounds for the Assouad and lower dimensions of self-affine measures supported on these sponges. The upper and lower bounds always coincide in dimensions <i>d</i>=2,3 yielding precise explicit formulae for the dimensions. Moreover, there are easy to check conditions guaranteeing that the bounds coincide for <i>d</i> &ge; 4. An interesting consequence of our results is that there can be a 'dimension gap' for such self-affine constructions, even in the plane. Joint work with J. M. Fraser.
