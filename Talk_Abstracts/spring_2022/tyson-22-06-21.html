Quasiconformal mappings are homeomorphisms with a uniform bound on the relative distortion of distance. They arise in diverse contexts in analysis and geometry, including dynamics, Kleinian groups, differential geometry, and analysis on fractals and in metric spaces. The distortion of dimension by quasiconformal maps (and maps in other regularity classes) is a classical subject going back to work of Gehring and V&auml;is&auml;l&auml; in the 1970s. I will discuss recent results on the quasiconformal distortion of Assouad dimension and the Assouad spectrum, with applications to the classification of planar polynomial spirals. An attractive feature of the latter classification is that it is sharp up to the level of the quasiconformal distortion. This talk is based on joint work with Efstathios Chrontsios Garitsis.
