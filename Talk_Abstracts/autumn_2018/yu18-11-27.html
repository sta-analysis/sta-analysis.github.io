 In this talk, I will show that geometric and arithmetic sequences have little in common. Two scenarios will be discussed. First, I will present a number theoretic problem which originates from a math olympiad question which asks whether for every integer m and k there is an integer n such that 2<sup>n</sup>+n&equiv; k mod m. Curiously, this result has a continuous version. We shall see that the fractional parts of 2<sup>n</sup> d+nc for n&#8805; 0  form a rather large set in [0,1].
