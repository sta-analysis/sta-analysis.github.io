Exploring the conditions sufficient or necessary for dimension drop to occur between the affinity and Hausdorff dimensions in homogeneous settings has been a major open problem in fractal geometry since the 1980s.  This talk will focus on a single question: given an affine homogeneous system exhibiting dimension drop, what conditions on the condensation set raise the dimension back up to the typical expected values? To set the scene, we'll also introduce the area and survey a few key past and recent dimension results.
