In this talk I will define a natural random recursive measure \(\mu\) on the unit line (multiplicative cascade).  Given this positive but finite measure \(\mu\), write \(f(x)=\mu([0,x))\) for the cumulative distribution function (CDF).  A natural question to ask is:<br><br>

<em>Given any subset \(E\) of [0,1] with Hausdorff/box-counting/packing dimension \(d\), what is the (almost sure) dimension of the image set \(f(E)\)?</em>
<br><br>
I will attempt to answer this question by discussing a paper by Benjamini and Schramm which answers the questions for the Hausdorff dimension. Time permitting, I will talk about the upper box-counting dimension.
