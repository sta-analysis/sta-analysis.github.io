I will present a result that shows that any Lebesgue-measurable set in &#8477;<sup><i>d</i></sup> with density larger than (<i>n-2</i>)/(<i>n-1</i>) contains similar copies of every <i>n</i>-point set at all sufficiently large scales. I will also give an example to show that the density required to guarantee all large similar copies of <i>n</i>-point sets tends to 1 at a rate 1- O(<i>n</i><sup>-1/5</sup>log<i>n</i>). Joint work with Kenneth Falconer and 
Vjekoslav Kova&#269;.
