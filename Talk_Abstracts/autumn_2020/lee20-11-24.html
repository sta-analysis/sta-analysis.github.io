We study a natural class of invariant measures supported on the attractors of a family of nonlinear, non-conformal iterated function systems introduced by Falconer, Fraser and Lee. These are pushforward quasi-Bernoulli measures, a class which includes Gibbs measures. We show that these measures are exact dimensional and that their exact dimensions satisfy a Ledrappier-Young formula. Based on joint work with Natalia Jurga.
