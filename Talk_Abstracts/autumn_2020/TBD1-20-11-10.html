Being the best of times and the worst of times... I plan to present two variational principles from two distinct realms of research in dimension theory -- self-affine fractals and metric Diophantine approximation. The talk will be accessible to students and faculty interested in some convex combination of dynamics, Diophantine approximation, and fractal geometry. Most importantly, I hope to present a sampling of open questions and directions that have yet to be explored.
