 I will discuss a notion of regular set and measure (roughly, a homogeneous Moran construction), and how to extract "large" regular sets and measures from arbitrary ones. Even though this is essentially just an application of the pigeonhole principle, it plays a key role in some deep theorems of Bourgain (where I learned about it) and also in my recent work on distance sets and intersections of Cantor sets.
