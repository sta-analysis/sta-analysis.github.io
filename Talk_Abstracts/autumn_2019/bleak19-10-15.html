Boyle and Krieger [1987] give a complete invariant for conjugacy of automorphisms for one-sided shifts of finite type.  If two automorphisms are not conjugate, then in finite time you can detect this using the `gyration' and `sign' vectors (infinite vectors generated from the automorphisms taking values, in the first case, in Z/nZ in the nth coordinate, and in the second case,  in Z/2Z in each coordinate).  However, while these invariants can be constructed from given automorphisms, finding an automorphism with given invariance vectors is not an easy task (and in general, one cannot just pick any two vectors).  

  Boyle has proposed the following question: Consider the full (one-sided) shift on n-letters.  Does there exists an automorphism A of order n acting freely on the shift space (every point has an orbit of length n under the action of the automorphism), but where A is not conjugate to a permutation on n letters?  We will discuss these invariants, and then, give an automorphism of the sort in Boyle's question.  Joint with Feyisayo Olukoya.
