Let &nu; be a deterministic measure. We wish to find a random measure that solves E(&mu;) = &nu; while &mu; is supported on the Brownian path 
and is nicely spread so we can use it as a tool for geometric measure theory of the Brownian path. We describe when a problem
can be solved and we provide a solution. We outline the possible application of the random measures. The theory is developed for more general
closed sets than the Brownian path.
