Conformal dimension is a powerful tool in the study of metric spaces. It was originally introduced to study rank one symmetric spaces, but has also proved useful in the study of boundaries of hyperbolic groups and other fractal metric spaces. Considering conformal dimension within the framework of Geometric Group Theory, I have defined a related notion that I am calling H&#246;lder dimension, which is an invariant of H&#246;lder equivalence in the same way that conformal dimension is an invariant of quasi-symmetric equivalence. I will define what H&#246;lder dimension is, illustrate why it is a natural concept to consider, present some of my results regarding H&#246;lder dimension, and conclude with some open questions.
