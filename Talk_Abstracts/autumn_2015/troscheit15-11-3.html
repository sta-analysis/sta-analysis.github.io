In this talk we will give a brief history of the study of affine carpets, both deterministic and random, and will introduce random homogeneous and random recursive (1-variable and \(\infty\)-variable, respectively) box-like carpets. We will introduce the notion of 'arrangements of words' and show that the box-counting dimension is almost surely given by the zero of a pressure function involving a modified singular value function.
If time allows we will give a few examples that exhibit interesting 'dimension drops' and say a few words about the proof, which involves sub-additive ergodic theory (1-variable case) and supermartingales (\(\infty\)-variable).
