An inhomogeneous fractal set is one which exhibits different scaling behaviour at different points.  Assouad dimension finds the 'most difficult location and scale' at which to cover the set, and the difference between it and box dimension can be thought of as a measure of the inhomogeneity of the set: useful, but rather coarse information.  In this talk I'll present a new detailed quantitative analysis of inhomogeneity via a local version of Assouad dimension, which for standard examples yields a large deviations principle.  This is joint work with Jon Fraser (Manchester).
