Given a convergent family of interval maps and the associated family of SRB/physical measures, one might hope that the measures would converge to the SRB measure of the limit map.  In non-uniformly hyperbolic systems, this naive approach can fail.  I'll give sharp conditions on precisely when this failure occurs for a very general class of maps.  This is part of a wider study of continuity of thermodynamic quantities in collaboration with Neil Dobbs.
