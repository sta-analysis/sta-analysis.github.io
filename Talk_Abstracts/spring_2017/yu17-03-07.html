Assouad dimension and lower dimension can tell us certain local extreme property of fractal sets. A fractal is 'homogeneous' means that it has the same property everywhere in itself, Assouad dimension can tell us if there is somewhere in fractal which is very 'dense' in some sense. In this talk, I will explain some results of Assouad/lower dimension of some certain graphs of functions. Examples includes : Takagi function, graphs of Levy-process (Wiener process).
