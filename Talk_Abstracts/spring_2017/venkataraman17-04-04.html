We consider a coupled bulk-surface system of partial differential equations with nonlinear coupling, that arises as a simplification of a mathematical model for receptor-ligand interactions. Nondimensionalisation of the model leads one to consider a number of biologically relevant asymptotic limits of the model. 

In this talk we develop a mathematical theory for the treatment of the original model together with a rigorous proof of convergence to a number of limiting  bulk-surface free boundary problems in the aforementioned limits. Connections will be made between certain classical free boundary problems and the limit problems. The theoretical results will be supported by computations of the original and reduced problems.
