The topic of this talk revolves around the following question: given a Kleinian group &Gamma; and <i>r</i>>0, how many horoballs (Euclidean balls tangent to the boundary of hyperbolic space at parabolic points) of radius &#8776; <i>r</i> should be expect to see? We will discuss a result of Stratmann and Velani which gives global information regarding this question and then provide some localisations of this result where we restrict our attention to small balls in the limit set. We will also discuss some applications of our results to Diophantine approximation and the dimension theory of conformal measures supported on the limit set. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
