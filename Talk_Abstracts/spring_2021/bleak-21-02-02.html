The role of subgraphs of de Bruijn graphs in genetics has been establish for some time now.  In this talk, we will explore a new technique for modifying de Bruijn graphs to enable finer control in setting up context sensitive Markov Models, and we explain briefly a first impact in genetic modelling.  Joint with Andy Lynch and Anja Minsaas.
