Quasisymmetries are an important class of homeomorphisms between metric spaces related to quasiconformal geometry.  In this talk, I will explain how certain finitely ramified fractals support a natural family of quasisymmetrically equivalent metrics with respect to which any homeomorphism that locally preserves the cellular structure is a quasisymmetry, and I will discuss applications of these results to the quasisymmetry groups of finitely ramified Julia sets.  This is joint work with Bradley Forrest.
