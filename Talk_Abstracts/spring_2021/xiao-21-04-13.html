We will be mainly interested in connected components of a specific class of planar self-similar sets called fractal squares. I will first introduce several existing criteria on connected and totally disconnected fractal squares, and then talk about how to characterize fractal squares with finitely many connected components. Some methods can also be applied to carpet-like self-affine sets such as Bedford-McMullen carpets.
