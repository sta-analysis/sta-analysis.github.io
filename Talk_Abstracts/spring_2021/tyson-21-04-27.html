I will survey the theory of distortion of dimension by mappings with prescribed regularity. The main focus will be on distortion of Hausdorff dimension, although other notions (e.g. box-counting dimension and Assouad dimension) will also show up. We primarily consider maps in the first-order Sobolev class <i>W</i><sup>1,<i>p</i></sup> and quasiconformal maps. Classical results in this area date back to the work of Gehring and V&#228;is&#228;l&#228; in the 1970s, and concern the effect of a fixed quasiconformal mapping on the dimension of a fixed set. I will also discuss more recent work on the distortion of dimension by a fixed mapping on generic elements in parameterized families of sets. To keep things simple, we will restrict attention to finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces, however, many of the results which I will discuss have extensions to, or interesting modifications in non-Riemannian manifolds and more general metric spaces.
