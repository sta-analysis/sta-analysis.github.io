We are interested in rare events for dynamical systems, i.e. orbit visits to small sets of the phase space. In 2010, Freitas, Freitas and Todd linked the study of recurrence properties of a dynamical system to Extreme Value Theory and Point Process theory. In the presence of clustering of extreme events, the problem becomes more interesting and received attention over the subsequent years. In this talk, after a fast-forwarded overview of the theory, we focus on the piling process introduced in the most recent work of Freitas, Freitas and Todd, via some worked out examples. In particular, the existence of such well-defined structure is a requirement for the Enriched Functional Limit Theorems derived in the same paper, however the piling process may on its own provide a new insight to clustering patterns.
