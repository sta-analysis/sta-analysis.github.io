We examine boundaries of hyperbolic spaces, and actions thereon.  Two sorts of boundaries enter our discussion: Gromov's visual boundary, and the horofunction boundary determined by Busemann functions.  Considering natural actions on metric spaces (e.g., by isometries), we can pass to induced actions on the various notions of boundary.  In this regard, there is a well-known theorem of Kapovich and Benakli that a hyperbolic group acts with finite kernel on its visual boundary.  In our talk, we analyse this action to discover that the action can actually be modelled by specialised finite state automata called transducers.  In consequence, we prove that a very broad class of hyperbolic groups (including the torsion free groups) act faithfully and `rationally' on their boundary, providing a new approach to the study of this vast and interesting class of groups.  Joint with Jim Belk and Francesco Matucci.
