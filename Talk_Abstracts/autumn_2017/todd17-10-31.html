I will show how the form of the pressure function for a dynamical system determines its statistical limit laws.  This is particularly interesting when the system has slow mixing properties, or, even more extreme, in the null recurrent case (where the system has an infinite measure).  I will start by introducing these ideas for simple interval maps with nice Gibbs measures and then indicate how this generalises.  This is joint work with Henk Bruin and Dalia Terhesiu.
