J. Rouyer recently proved that a typical compact metric space belonging to the Gromov-Hausdorff space (of all compact metric spaces) has Hausdorff and lower box dimension as small as possible (namely zero), and upper box dimension as large as possible (namely infinity). We study a similar dichotomy for various fractal measures. We also present several applications of our results. For example, as an application, we show that
the packing dimension of a typical compact space equals infinity. This talk is based on joint work by S. Jurina, N. Macgregor, A. Mitchell, L. Olsen, and A. Stylianou.
