Based on a result of Powers, who shows that the reduced C* algebra of any non-abelian free group is simple, Kesten built a condition/test which one can use in more general groups to understand the ideal structure of the reduced C* algebras of the groups.

In this update of a talk from the Fall, we show that Kesten's test fails for R. Thompson's group T.  We go on to give another condition which is nominally weaker than Kesten's, but which affords similar consequences, and we show with much greater effort that this new Kesten-type condition still fails for T, although it allows for easier proofs of the simplicity of the reduced C* algebras for many groups.

In this talk the focus will not be on the C* algebras side, but rather on the tests themselves, and their failure in T.  Joint with Kate Juschenko.
