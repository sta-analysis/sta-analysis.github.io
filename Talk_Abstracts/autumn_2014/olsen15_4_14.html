The purpose of this talk is to
introduce a class of subsets of \(\Bbb N\) defined in terms of
the asymptotic behaviour of the digits in the \(N\)-ary expansion of
the integers, and to study the "fractal" dimensions of these sets.

As an example we consider discrete Besicovitch-Eggleston
subsets of the positive integers \(\Bbb N\) based on the frequencies
of digits in the \(N\)-ary expansion of positive integers, and show that
the "fractional" dimensions of these sets satisfy a formula analogous
to the classical Besicovitch-Eggleston dimension formula for the
Hausdorff dimension of the usual Besicovitch-Eggleston subsets of \(\Bbb R\).
