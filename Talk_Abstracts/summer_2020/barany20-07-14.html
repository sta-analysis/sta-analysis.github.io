The multifractal spectrum of Birkhoff averages over shift spaces or self-conformal sets has been studied widely and is relatively well understood. In this talk, we study the multifractal spectra of weighted Birkhoff averages over the shift space. Under some conditions on the weights, we calculate the spectrum. Our methods are applicable when the weights are defined by the M&#246;bius function with potentials depending on the first symbol. This is joint work with Michal Rams and Ruxi Shi.
