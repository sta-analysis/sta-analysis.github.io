The Derrida-Retaux System is a simple dynamical system on random variables in statistical physics. The concept was formally raised by Bernard Derrida and Martin Retaux in 2014, as a toy model for the longstanding Poland-Scheraga model of DNA transition. 

An example would be the initial distribution <i>X</i><sup> 0</sup> which takes value 0 with probability 1-<i>p</i> and takes value 2 with probability <i>p</i>. The iteration relationship is that <i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i>+1</sup> = (<i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>+<i>Y</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>-1)<sup>+</sup> (where (<i>a</i>)<sup>+</sup> = max{<i>a</i>,0}), where <i>Y</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup> is i.i.d with <i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>.

The free energy is defined to be the limit of &#120124;(<i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>)/2<sup><i>n</i></sup>. There exists a critical value <i>p<sub>c</sub></i> such that when <i>p < p<sub>c</sub></i> the free energy is 0, but when <i>p > p<sub>c</sub></i> the free energy is positive.

Surprisingly in 1984, Collect, Eckmann, etc. discovered a precise formula to calculate <i>p<sub>c</sub></i> when the initial distribution is integer-valued from the viewpoint of real dynamics. In this talk I will mainly present a 'surprising' result in my undergraduate thesis: their formula holds if and only if the initial distribution is integer-valued. I will also talk about a recent breakthrough on the phase transition order by Shi, etc. (2019).
