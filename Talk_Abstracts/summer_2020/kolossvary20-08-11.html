The intermediate dimensions of a set &#923;, elsewhere denoted by dim<sub>&#952;</sub> &#923;, interpolate between its Hausdorff and box dimensions using the parameter &#952; &#8712; [0,1]. Determining a precise formula for dim<sub>&#952;</sub> &#923; is particularly challenging when &#923; is a Bedford-McMullen carpet with distinct Hausdorff and box dimension. In this talk, after giving an overview, we will present an argument that shows that dim<sub>&#952;</sub> &#923; is strictly less than the box dimension of &#923; for every &#952; < 1. Time permitting, we will also show how to improve on the lower bound obtained by Falconer, Fraser, and Kempton.
