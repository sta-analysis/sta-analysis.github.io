The popcorn function, also known as Thomae's function or the modified Dirichlet function, is an important example in real analysis. The corresponding graph set, called the popcorn graph, contains fractal and number theoretical structures. In this talk, we will talk about properties and the dimensions of the popcorn graph, which seems straightforward but relies on delicate counting arguments and some deep results from number theory. This is joint work with Jonathan Fraser and Han Yu.
