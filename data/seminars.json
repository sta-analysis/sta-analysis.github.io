    "title": "Density estimate from below in relation to a conjecture of A. Zygmund on Lipschitz differentiation",
    "abstract": "This talk is about a generalisation of the Lebesgue density theorem. With each point x in the plane, we associate a line L(x) containing x and we ask whether, for each Borel-measurable subset A of the plane, the density ratio H<sup>1</sup>(A &cap; B(x,r) &cap; L(x))/2r converges to 1 as r &searr; 0, for a.e. x &isin; A. Here, H<sup>1</sup> is the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The answer depends on the regularity of the mapping L : x &#8614; L(x). If the direction of L is constant, then the answer is positive, according to the Lebesgue density theorem in the real line combined with Fubini's theorem. For some L whose direction is merely continuous, the answer is negative due to the existence of a Nikodym set and, in fact, the above density ratio may vanish for all x &isin; A. I will report on the following progress: if the direction of L is Lipschitz then the superior limit of the above density ratio exceeds 1/4 for a.e. x &isin; A."

This leads to an L<sup>p</sup> to L<sup>2</sup> estimate for restriction on multifractals. Joint work with Marc Carnovale and Jonathan Fraser."

    "abstract": "We study the topological and fractal properties of self-similar sets on the real line, generated by an IFS with an integer similarity dimension and translations that possess a peculiar combinatorial property. A recent result obtained with O. Makarchuk on the Lebesgue measure of attractors, together with other findings, can help us uncover their topological structure. The most intriguing scenario arises when the attractor has a non-empty interior and a fractal boundary."

    "title": "Random subsets of self-similar sets",
    "abstract": "We consider random subsets of self-similar sets generated by a branching random walk with exponentially decreasing steps, or equivalently, via random labelings of the edges of a full infinite M-ary tree. These random subsets can be viewed as statistically self-similar sets with extreme overlaps, hence their almost-sure box-counting and Hausdorff dimensions coincide. We show that the computation of this dimension breaks into three essentially different cases, depending on the parameters of the model. In one case, the random subset has the same dimension as the self-similar set it is part of, although it is almost surely a proper subset. We give precise formulas for the dimension in the other two cases. This is joint work with Lauritz Streck."

    "abstract": "We compute the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of random self-affine sponges in R<sup>d</sup> without imposing any separation conditions. In this context, randomness arises from the matrices in the defining semigroup, which are random yet the corresponding affine maps share a fixed point. This setup reveals a novel phenomenon: the almost sure Hausdorff dimension---even in the separated self-similar case---depends on the specific way randomness is introduced into the matrices. This talk presents ongoing research conducted with Balázs Bárány and Michal Rams."

Given an upper bound on the dimension of this midpoint collection, we establish a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the corresponding Kakeya set. As a corollary, we obtain a result that implies the Kakeya conjecture under certain conditions. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser."

In this talk we will discuss a quantitative version of this fact and its connection to the fractal properties of the measure m. This is ongoing work with Mike Todd."

    "abstract": "We introduce left-continuous automatic groups as a subclass of the well-known automatic groups.  The class of left-continuous automatic groups is a bit mysterious as a subclass of the automatic groups, but, we know at least that the class contains the CAT(0) Cubical Complex groups (CCC groups), which themselves represent a broad class of groups of topical interest.  Our main theorem states that all left-continuous automatic groups embed as subgroups of the rational group R, a group introduced in 2000 by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych, and Suschanskii.  We will provide definitions and examples of these various groups along the way, and have some discussion as well of different forms of boundaries of groups.  We also discuss how similar embedding theorems have been of use in larger programs of discovery.  Joint work with Belk, Chatterji, Matucci and Perego."
