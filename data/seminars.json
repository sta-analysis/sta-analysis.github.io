    "title": "Lower Assouad-type dimensions: old and new",
    "abstract": "The lower Assouad-type dimensions, the natural dual to well-studied Assouad-type dimensions, is a family of fractal dimensions describing and quantifying the coarse parts of a set. In this talk, we will recall the definition of lower Assouad-type dimensions with their properties, then show some ongoing progress on the generalised lower Assouad dimension, including the interpolation and attainable forms on lower Assouad-type dimensions."

    "abstract": "Given a parametrised family of dynamical systems, its bifurcation locus is the set of parameters which describes the boundary between different types of stable dynamics. Bifurcation loci have been subject to a wealth of study in complex dynamics, the most well known example being the Mandelbrot set. In this talk we will discuss an analogous notion for linear cocycles."

    "title": "The Fourier spectrum under orthogonal projections",
    "abstract": "Since Marstrand’s work on orthogonal projections in the 1950s, exceptional set estimates for such projections have been widely studied. Salem sets, i.e. sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide, have no such exceptions. Thus, one might expect that the Fourier dimension could be used to improve exceptional set estimates. In this talk we will tackle this problem and show how the Fourier spectrum can be used to provide more information. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser."

    "title": "Fourier decay of product measures",
    "abstract": "Product sets and measures are useful constructions in many contexts.  They can be used to build examples with exotic behaviour (e.g. take the product of two measures with very different properties) and can provide ''toy models'' for more difficult problems (e.g. the product of a x2 invariant measure with a x3 invariant measure is a simple example of a measure invariant under the non-conformal toral endomorphism (x2, x3) ).  The Fourier transform of a measure provides a lot of useful geometric information and we will discuss the simple question: can one effectively describe the Fourier decay of a product measure MxN in terms of the Fourier decay of M and N?"
