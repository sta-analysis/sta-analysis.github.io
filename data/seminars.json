    "title": "Lower Assouad-type dimensions: old and new",
    "abstract": "The lower Assouad-type dimensions, the natural dual to well-studied Assouad-type dimensions, is a family of fractal dimensions describing and quantifying the coarse parts of a set. In this talk, we will recall the definition of lower Assouad-type dimensions with their properties, then show some ongoing progress on the generalised lower Assouad dimension, including the interpolation and attainable forms on lower Assouad-type dimensions."

    "abstract": "Given a parametrised family of dynamical systems, its bifurcation locus is the set of parameters which describes the boundary between different types of stable dynamics. Bifurcation loci have been subject to a wealth of study in complex dynamics, the most well known example being the Mandelbrot set. In this talk we will discuss an analogous notion for linear cocycles."
