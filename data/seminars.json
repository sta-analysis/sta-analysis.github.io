    "abstract": "Classical results from symbolic dynamics and thermodynamic formalism tell us about the dynamical/ergodic properties of Hölder functions on subshifts of finite type. In this talk we’ll discuss how to extend some of these results to a general class of functions called quasi-morphisms. We’ll also discuss some applications of these results to geometric problems."

In particular, we will prove that \"multifractal decomposition sets\" are the building blocks from which all other &Pi;<sub>&gamma;</sub><sup>0</sup>-sets can be constructed; more, precisely, \"multifractal decomposition sets\" are &Pi;<sub>&gamma;</sub><sup>0</sup>-complete.\n\nAs an application we find the position of the classical Eggleston-Besicovitch set in the Baire Hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "This talk will give a brief introduction to the symmetry problem for self-similar sets. We resolve the problem in R^3, and I will share some of the key ideas involved in both the R^2 and R^3 cases. I will also outline the difficulties that arise when attempting to extend these methods to higher-dimensional spaces."
