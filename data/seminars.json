    "abstract": "This talk is about a generalisation of the Lebesgue density theorem. With each point x in the plane, we associate a line L(x) containing x and we ask whether, for each Borel-measurable subset A of the plane, the density ratio H<sup>1</sup>(A &cap; B(x,r) &cap; L(x))/2r converges to 1 as r &searr; 0, for a.e. x &isin; A. Here, H<sup>1</sup> is the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The answer depends on the regularity of the mapping L : x &#8614; L(x). If the direction of L is constant, then the answer is positive, according to the Lebesgue density theorem in the real line combined with Fubini's theorem. For some L whose direction is merely continuous, the answer is negative due to the existence of a Nikodym set and, in fact, the above density ratio may vanish for all x &isin; A. I will report on the following progress: if the direction of L is Lipschitz then the superior limit of the above density ratio exceeds 1/4 for a.e. x &isin; A."
