I will discuss some open problems that I have thought about over the last 30 years. Some are well known (e.g., growth rate of DLA), but a few may be novel, such as the flow associated to a planar triangulation. There will be many pictures, results of some computer experiments, but very few theorems or proofs.  This is essentially three mini-lectures on independent topics strung together.
