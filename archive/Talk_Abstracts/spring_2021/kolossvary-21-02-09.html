This talk will present an argument based on using the method of types to calculate the box dimension of sets. Demonstrating first on self-similar sets,  we then use it to generalize the formula for the box dimension of self-affine carpets of Gatzouras-Lalley and of Bara&#324;ski type to their higher dimensional sponge analogues. In addition to a closed form, we also obtain a variational formula which resembles the Ledrappier-Young formula for Hausdorff dimension.
