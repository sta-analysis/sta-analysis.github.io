For Assouad spectrum see the introduction in the abstract the week before. This week I will continue talking about some further properties and specific examples of the Assouad spectrum which Dr Jonathan Fraser did not cover last week due to the lacking of time. This talk will contain the bi-Hölder property of Assouad spectrum and a nice application to bi-Hölder unwinding of spirals. Then I will give an example of computing the Assouad spectrum of the famous Mandelbrot perculation.
