Some recurrence limit laws are more sensitive to slow mixing in a dynamical system than others.  Fixing a hole and considering the exponential rate of escape of mass through it as time goes to infinity will result in a degenerate limit if the mixing is too slow for the hole size (i.e. slow exponential, or even subexponential).  Shrinking the hole linearly with time (Hitting Time Statistics) gives non-degenerate limit laws in all known mixing cases.  I’ll discuss a general framework for these limits and show how they can detect mixing rates.  This is joint work with Henk Bruin and Mark Demers.
