In this talk I will give an overview of how random sets that exhibit some form of stochastic self-similarity can be studied with methods from dimension theory. In particular, I will elaborate on the family of Assouad-type dimensions which have attracted a lot of recent attention in fractal geometry. Their usefulness stems from their link to embedding theory and the Assouad dimension(s) can be used to answer embedding problems in random geometry. The behaviour of the Assouad spectrum exhibits "geometric phase transitions" and can be used to quantify such phase changes in random (or deterministic) sets. I will give a survey of recent results and talk about the embeddability of the Brownian continuum random tree and the Brownian map using quasi-symmetric mappings.
