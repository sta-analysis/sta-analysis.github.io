In the 1988 textbook "Fractals Everywhere", M. Barnsley introduced an iterative random procedure for generating fractals which is coined the "Chaos Game". Two natural questions are: what is the expected time taken by this procedure to become <i>r</i>-dense in the fractal, and for which measure can this expected time be minimised? In this talk we will discuss how the box dimension of the measure comes into play and characterise the family of probability vectors that minimise the expected time in the case of Bernoulli measures defined on Bedford-McMullen carpets. Based on joint work with Bal&#225;zs B&#225;r&#225;ny and Natalia Jurga.
