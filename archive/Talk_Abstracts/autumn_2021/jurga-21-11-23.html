Given a dynamical system <i>f</i> : <i>I</i> &#8614; <i>I</i> we study the asymptotic expected behaviour of the cover time: the rate at which orbits become dense in the state space <i>I</i>. We will see how this can be studied through the lens of dynamical systems with holes and the spectral theory of the transfer operators associated to these systems. This is joint work with Mike Todd.
