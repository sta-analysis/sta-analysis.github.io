We start with two concepts, both originating more than 50 years ago. Marstrand's 1954 projection theorem regarding orthogonal projections of Borel sets in the plane, and Furstenberg's sumset conjecture, regarding sumsets of sets invariant under T<sub>2</sub>(x)=2x mod1 and T<sub>3</sub>(x)=3x mod1. Hochman and Shmerkin's breakthrough paper in 2012 provided both a strengthening of Marstrand's projection theorem for self-similar sets with irrational rotations, and a full resolution of Furstenberg's sumset conjecture. The key to both proofs is the method of CP-chains, a theory devised by Furstenberg himself and developed by Hochman and Shmerkin to tackle problems in fractal geometry and geometric measure theory. We will discuss this method and some of the numerous results it has helped to prove in recent years.
