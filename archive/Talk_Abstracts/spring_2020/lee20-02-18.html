We study Bernoulli measures in the plane supported on sets defined by iterated function systems consisting of nonlinear maps. These maps have triangular Jacobian matrices and satisfy an appropriate separation condition. Using ideas from thermodynamic formalism we are able to calculate the L<sup>q</sup>-spectrum of such measures and as a corollary we obtain the box dimension of the sets they are supported on.
