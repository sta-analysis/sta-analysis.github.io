The Sullivan dictionary provides a conceptual framework to study the relationships between Kleinian groups and rational maps. Stemming from work due to Sullivan in the 1980s, the dictionary now includes numerous analogous results, even with similar proofs. One particularly strong correspondence is that from the perspective of dimension theory, where in both the Kleinian group setting and the rational map setting, many notions of dimension are given by some critical exponent. In this talk, I will discuss how by slightly expanding the family of dimensions considered, in particular to dimensions of Assouad-type, we find a richer family of similarities between the two settings and, perhaps more interestingly, some clear differences. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser.
