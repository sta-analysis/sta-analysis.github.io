The dimension theory of orthogonal projections of fractal sets is fairly well-known and well-understood.  It is equally natural to consider families of nonlinear projections (e.g. radial projections) and similar phenomena are known to hold provided the family has enough 'transversality'.  I will discuss a recent nonlinear projection theorem for Assouad dimension and then use this to completely resolve the Assouad dimension analogue of the distance set problem for sets in the plane.
