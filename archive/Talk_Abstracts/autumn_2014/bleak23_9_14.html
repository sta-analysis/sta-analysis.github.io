We explore the conditions under which a set of PL homeomorphisms of the unit interval will generate groups of high ''complexity'' under different interpretations of complexity.  We show that under easy-to-describe dynamical conditions there are really just three cases of interest (in broad strokes), leading to groups of vastly different complexity. Joint with Tara Brough and Susan Hermiller.
