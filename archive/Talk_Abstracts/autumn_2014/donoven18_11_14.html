In this talk, I will describe my recent paper with Kenneth Falconer on the intersection of fractal subsets of Cantor sets.  I will provide probabilistic bounds on the upper box-counting and Hausdorff dimensions of the intersection of a fixed fractal subset and the image of another under a random isometry of the Cantor space.
