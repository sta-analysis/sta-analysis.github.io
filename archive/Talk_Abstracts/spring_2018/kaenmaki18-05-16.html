We show that any Hausdorff measurable subset of self-conformal sets has comparable Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff content. In particular, this proves that self-conformal sets with positive Hausdorff measure are Ahlfors regular, irrespective of separation conditions. When restricting to the real line and self-conformal sets with Hausdorff dimension strictly less than one, we additionally show that Ahlfors regularity is equivalent to the weak separation condition. In fact, we resolve a self-conformal extension of the dimension drop conjecture for self-conformal sets with positive Hausdorff measure by showing that its Hausdorff dimension falls below the expected value if and only if there are exact overlaps. The talk is based on a recent work with Sascha Troscheit.
