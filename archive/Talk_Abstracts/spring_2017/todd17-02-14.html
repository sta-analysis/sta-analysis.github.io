Given a dynamical system with an invariant measure, the entropy gives a notion of the disorder of the system with respect to that measure. If we now take a convergent sequence of invariant measures, must the entropy of the measures also converge? In general the answer is no, and in fact upper semi-continuity (usc) is the best we can hope for. I'll discuss cases when we do get usc, give examples of how usc can fail, and hopefully give some ideas on how some weaker usc property might still be possible even when the standard usc fails.
