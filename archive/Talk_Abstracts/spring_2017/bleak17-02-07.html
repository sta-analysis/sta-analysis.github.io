Given a Cantor space C, we define a broad class of subgroups of the group of homeomorphisms of C so that, if a given group G is a subgroup of a finitely generated subgroup H of Homeo(C) and is in our class, we can immediately conclude that G is two-generated. The argument has connections with Higman and Epstein's general arguments toward simplicity for groups of homeomorphisms, and is general enough to immediately prove two-generation, e.g., for many relatives of the Thompson groups, and many other groups as well. Joint with James Hyde.
