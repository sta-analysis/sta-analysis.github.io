Inhomogeneous iterated function systems are natural generalisations of the classical iterated function systems, commonly used to generate examples of fractal sets.  The difference being that there is a fixed "condensation set" which is dragged into the construction.  Such systems have applications in image compression (the problem of efficiently storing large picture files) in situations where one wants to produce an image with lots of similar objects at different scales, such as a flock of seagulls or a forest.  I will review some structural properties of these attractors and go on to discuss their dimension theory.

Some of this talk will be joint work with Simon Baker and Andras Mathe (both at Warwick).
