There is a long history about the relationship between the size of a set and the presence of geometric patterns, such as arithmetic progressions. It is well known that sets of positive Lebesgue measure contain a homothetic copy of every finite pattern. We will see that Hausdorff measure (and Hausdorff dimension) cannot be used to detect existence or nonexistence of patterns inside sets. So, if we want to guarantee the presence of patterns in a set, we need a different notion of size. I will talk about a work in progress in which I guarantee the presence of certain patterns in sets of large thickness. This two concepts had not been connected until now. The proof is simple and it is based on variants of Schmidt's game. I will also share some questions with you.
