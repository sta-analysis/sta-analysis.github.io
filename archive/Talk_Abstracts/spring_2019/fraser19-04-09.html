Given two homeomorphic subsets of the plane, how regular can a homeomorphism be mapping one set to the other? Here, "regular" refers to Lipschitz or Holder conditions. I will discuss a concrete example of this type of question, known as the "winding problem", where the sets in question are a line segment and a spiral. This problem has applications and origins in conformal welding and the modelling of turbulence in fluid dynamics. Given time, there will be a competitive audience participation section of the talk where we engage in the fractal analogue of the grand national.
