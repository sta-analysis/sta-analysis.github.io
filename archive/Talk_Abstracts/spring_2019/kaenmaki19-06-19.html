We consider planar self-affine sets X satisfying the strong separation condition and the projection condition. We show that any two points of X, which are generic with respect to a self-affine measure having simple Lyapunov spectrum, share the same collection of tangent sets. We also calculate the Assouad dimension of X and show that it is minimal for the conformal Assouad dimension. The talk is based on joint work with Balázs Bárány and Eino Rossi.
