For a non-generic, yet dense subset of $C^1$ expanding Markov maps of the interval
we prove the existence of uncountably many Lyapunov optimizing measures which are ergodic,
fully supported and have positive entropy. These measures are equilibrium states for some
H\"older continuous potentials. We also prove the existence of another non-generic dense subset
for which the optimizing measure is unique and supported on a periodic orbit.
A key ingredient is a new $C^1$ perturbation lemma which allows us to interpolate
between expanding Markov maps and the shift map on a finite number of symbols.
