An old conjecture of Erdos-Turan states that any set of positive integers whose reciprocals form a divergent series should contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  I will discuss connections between (almost) arithmetic progressions, weak tangents, and Assouad dimension and give a simple proof that sets of positive integers whose reciprocals form a divergent series get arbitrarily close to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
 
This is joint work with Han Yu.
