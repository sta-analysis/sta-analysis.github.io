Diophantine approximation is a branch of analytic number theory that aims to understand how well real numbers may be approximated by rationals. In this talk I will provide an introduction to Diophantine approximation for those who are unfamiliar with the subject. I will also show how we can establish analogues of classical theorems from the real line on more complicated spaces, such as manifolds.
