Sumsets have been studied for many years in several different contexts, in particular the dimension of sumsets has often been considered. Thanks to the recent inverse theorem of Hochman we can study the limiting behaviour of the upper box and Assouad dimensions of iterated sumsets, with self-similar sets providing particularly nice examples. This is joint work with Jonathan Fraser and Han Yu.
