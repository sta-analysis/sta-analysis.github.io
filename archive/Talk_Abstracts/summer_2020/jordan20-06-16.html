On the line Hochman has a result showing that the dimension of a self-similar measure is given by the minimum entropy divided by lyapunov exponent and 1 as long as an exponential separation property is satisfied. We will show how this can be extended to the dimension of all ergodic measures projected onto self-similar sets satisfying the same exponential separation property. The main tool used will be Shmerkin's result on the <i>L</i><sup><i>q</i></sup> dimensions of self-similar measures. This is joint work with Ariel Rapaport.
