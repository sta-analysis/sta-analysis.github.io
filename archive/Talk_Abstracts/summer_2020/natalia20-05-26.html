A finite set of matrices <i>A</i> &#8838; SL(2,&#8477;) acts on one-dimensional real projective space &#8477;P<sup>1</sup> through its linear action on &#8477;<sup>2</sup>. In this talk we will be interested in the smallest closed subset of &#8477;P<sup>1</sup> which is invariant under the projective action of <i>A</i>. Recently, Solomyak and Takahashi proved that if <i>A</i> is uniformly hyperbolic and satisfies a Diophantine property, then the invariant set has Hausdorff dimension equal to the minimum of 1 and the critical exponent. In this talk we will discuss an extension of their result beyond the uniformly hyperbolic setting. This is based on joint work with Argyrios Christodoulou.
