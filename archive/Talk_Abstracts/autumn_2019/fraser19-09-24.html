How dimension behaves under projection from the plane onto lines is a well-studied problem in fractal geometry. For many notions of dimension there is an 'almost sure constancy result' - often referred to as a 'Marstrand phenomenon.' The Assouad dimension behaves rather differently and this will be the focus of the talk. The recent work I will talk about is joint with Antii Kaenmaki (University of Eastern Finland).
