Recent work of Freitas, Freitas and Todd (2020) establishes the existence of enriched functional limit theorems for dynamical systems, in particular, the existence of functional limit theorems for dynamical sums of heavy tailed random variables in an enriched space where clustering patterns are not lost. Clustering phenomena arise naturally in the dynamical context due to the recurrence properties of the underlying systems. The crucial device that allows for keeping record of the clustering structure is called the piling process and was introduced in the aforementioned work. The main aim of this talk is to exhibit the piling processes for some concrete examples where the dynamics is (2<i>x</i> mod 1, 3<i>y</i> mod 1). If time permits, we will comment on how the functional limit theorems can then be derived and present their explicit form for the previously worked out examples. This is based on ongoing PhD work under the supervision of Mike Todd.
