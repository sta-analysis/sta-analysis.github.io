A group <i>G</i> is said to be 3/2's-generated if for any 1 &ne; <i>g</i> &isin; <i>G</i>, there is <i>h</i> &isin; <i>G</i> so that <<i>h</i>,<i>g</i>> = <i>G</i>.  Further, <i>G</i> is uniformly 3/2's-generated if <i>h</i> can always be chosen from some fixed conjugacy class {<i>c<sup>x</sup></i> | <i>x</i> &isin; <i>G</i>} of elements.   Being 3/2's-generated is a theme for (all but finitely many) finite simple groups, and it is natural to consider whether all infinite finitely presented groups are 3/2's-generated.  It is known that R. Thompson's group <i>V</i> is 3/2's-generated, but known arguments do not extend to similar arguments for <i>V</i>'s finitely presented simple subgroup <i>T</i>.  In this talk, we use the action of <i>T</i> on the circle to show that <i>T</i> is uniformly 3/2's generated.  We also briefly discuss what is known about a related concept: the spread of <i>T</i>.
