We study the shortest distance between two orbit segments of length <i>n</i> for rapidly mixing dynamical systems. We will show that the asymptotic behavior is given by a dimension-like quantity associated to the invariant measure, called its correlation dimension (or R&eacute;nyi entropy). 
For the shift map, we will show that this problem corresponds to a well-known sequences matching problem: the longest common substring problem.
We will also extend this study to the realm of random dynamical systems and explain the difference between the annealed and quenched version of this problem and how a non-smooth behavior of the associated asymptotic exponent may arise.
This includes some joint works with Vanessa Barros, Adriana Coutinho, Sebastien Gouezel, Rodrigo Lambert, Lingmin Liao and Manuel Stadlbauer.
