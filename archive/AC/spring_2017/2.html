I will continue discussing the proof of Freiman's Theorem. In particular, I will concentrate on the use of two tools: the discrete Fourier
 transform and the additive energy. These are powerful tools which are commonly used in additive combinatorics. The reduction of Freiman's
 Theorem to the finite case (Theorem 2.22) will be assumed and I will go on to construct Bohr neighbourhood's inside 2A-2A. I will plan to
 leave the final section, which proves that Bohr neighbourhood's contain arithmetic progressions, as homework for the dedicated participant.
