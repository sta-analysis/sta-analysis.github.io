Sum-Product bound in additive combinatorics is an important topic. We have seen before several results concerning the sum set structure of an commutative group, for integers all those results hold for both addition and multiplication. Intuitively, a set with a lot of additive structure is essentially a arithmetic progression, then it is far away from a geometric progression.  To formulate this idea we introduce the quantity $m(A)=\max\{A+A,A*A\}$ for a given finite set of integers. We will discuss some results relate $m(A)$ and $|A|$ in particular the theorem of Solymosi.
