<strong>Simon Baker (Loughborough University)</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-09-10">Expansions in non-integer bases</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-09-10"><p>A seemingly innocuous generalisation of binary expansions involves replacing 2 with a parameter q satisfying 1 < q < 2. This change leads to substantially different behaviour. For instance, a Lebesgue typical point has uncountably many expansions in base q. Moreover, for any integer k, there exists q and x such that x has precisely k expansions in base q. This is contrary to the case of binary expansions where every point has a unique expansion apart from a countable set of exceptions with precisely two. In this talk I will discuss some recent results on those bases that admit points with precisely k expansions. This talk will be based upon joint work with George Bender.</p></div>

<strong>Selim Ghazouani (UCL)</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-09-23">Speculations and problems about parabolic dynamical systems</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-09-23"><p>I will make an attempt at defining what a parabolic dynamical system is and will try to explain why, despite their relative unimportance in the modern theory of dynamical systems, they provide one with very entertaining questions to think about. Roughly speaking, a parabolic system it is a dynamical system for which nearby points drift apart at polynomial speed. An enticing feature of such systems is that they are all very different from one another, unlike hyperbolic systems which tend to enjoy fairly universal dynamical properties. The talk will build upon extensive numerical experiments, to illustrate known theorems as well as to invite open problems/conjectures.</p></div>

<strong>Jonathan Fraser</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-09-30">Dimension interpolation: the story so far</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-09-30"><p>Dimension interpolation is a general approach to understanding and characterising fractal objects.  The idea is to carefully define 'dimension functions' which live in-between familiar notions of fractal dimension, such as Hausdorff dimension, box dimension etc, with the hope of gaining more information than the individual notions provide in isolation.  I will motivate and survey this area by discussing several examples and applications.</p></div>

<strong>Stephen Cantrell</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-10-07">Understanding geometries through probability and dynamics</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-10-07"><p>I'll explain how it's possible to use tools from dynamical systems to study geometric problems. We'll also discuss how it's possible to use ideas from probability theory (such as Markov chains and random walks) to compare various geometric objects.  I'll present lots of simple motivating examples!</p></div>

<strong>Ana de Orellana</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-10-14">Curvature, transversality, and fractals</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-10-14"><p>Fourier restriction is a field of harmonic analysis that establishes the connection between Fourier analysis and the geometric properties of measures. In the last 20 years, much work has been done on the Fourier restriction problem in the fractal setting, and this has helped us understand precisely which conditions we need on the sets for the problem to make sense. Bilinear Fourier restriction estimates arose from the world of PDEs, but are of interest mainly as a means to obtain better estimates for the linear setting. In this talk we will review the history of both the linear and bilinear Fourier restriction problems, and see the first bilinear estimates for fractal measures. Joint work with Itamar Oliveira.</p></div>

    <h4 class="sem-date">October 16, 2025 <em>(2pm Thursday, Lecture Theatre D)</em></h4>
<strong>Alex Rutar (University of Jväskylä, Finland)</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-10-16">Conformal attractors, inhomogeneous iterated function systems, and branching functions</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-10-16"><p>The goal of this talk is to present common themes in the dimension theory of attractors of infinitely-generated self-conformal sets, and attractors of inhomogeneous finite self-conformal IFSs. In both cases, the structure of these attractors at a fixed (small, but finite) scale depends on the structure of some associated set (for infinite IFSs, the set of fixed points of the maps; and for inhomogeneous IFSs, the condensation set) at many scales simultaneously. A useful formalization when working with multi-scale properties of a set is the branching function: a Lipschitz function which encodes the asymptotics of the covering numbers at each fixed scale. I will introduce the theory of branching functions and explain how (modulo the usual technical assumptions) the branching function of the attractor depends only on the branching function of the associated set, as well as the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor. This can be used, for example, to give sharp bounds on lower box dimension which can have surprising consequences: for instance, the box dimension of the attractor exists if and only if either the upper box dimension of the associated set is at most the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor or the box dimension of the associated set exists.</p></div>

<strong>Mike Todd</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-10-28">Birkhoff spectrum for nonintegrable observables</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-10-28"><p>Given a dynamical system and some observable, consider the dimension of the sets of points with the same Birkhoff averages with respect to that observable: the Birkhoff spectrum.  When the observable is unbounded, the spectrum can behave in very different ways to the classical, bounded, case; for example the graph of the spectrum can be asymptotic to a maximum value, rather than reaching it and then decreasing.  I will present joint work with Iommi and Zhao considering a class of such cases and computing the form of this asymptotic limit, hopefully giving some ideas of thermodynamic formalism tools we use.</p></div>

<strong>Saeed Shaabanian</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-11-04">Covering time for Countable Markov Shifts</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-11-04"><p>Suppose we have a countable Markov shift equipped with a Gibbs measure. If the orbit of almost every point in this system is dense, a natural question arises regarding the rate at which these orbits become dense. For interval maps, this rate was obtained by N. Jurga and M. Todd. In this talk, we discuss how to estimate the covering rate for symbolic dynamics, how different metrics affect this rate, and, as it turns out, how this rate is related to the Minkowski dimension of the system.</p></div>

<strong>Lauritz Streck (University of Edinburgh)</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-11-11">Curves, combinatorics and the exact overlaps conjecture</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-11-11"><p>The exact overlaps conjecture concerning the dimension of self-similar measures has received significant attention over the years and was resolved by Varju in the case of one free parameter (Annals, 2019). Subsequently, Rapaport and Varju worked on the case of two free parameters and reduced the exact overlaps conjecture to a question about the entropy of certain curves in the parameter space (Duke, 2024). We present a partial answer to their question in the case of the IFS (ax, ax+1, ax+t, ax+1+t), corresponding to a convolution of two Bernoulli convolutions, and discuss the kind of combinatorial obstacles that need to be overcome for a full resolution.</p></div>

<strong>Firdavs Rakhmonov</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-11-18T16:00:00Z">Averages of the discrete Fourier transform, Salem sets, and applications</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-11-18T16:00:00Z"><p>The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has proven to be a fundamental tool for solving combinatorial and geometric problems in discrete settings. In general, sets whose DFTs admit uniform bounds are easier to analyze, but obtaining such bounds is sometimes impossible, even when many points satisfy strong pointwise estimates. One can replace the need for uniform bounds with L^p averages of the DFT. It turns out that this new approach has several interesting applications to the Fourier restriction problem and the study of orthogonal projections. This talk is based on a series of works with Jon Fraser.</p></div>

<strong>Jonathan Hickman (University of Edinburgh)</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-11-18T17:00:00Z">Counting integer points near space curves</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-11-18T17:00:00Z"><p>I will present joint work with Rajula Srivastava (UW Madison) on counting integer points which lie in a neighbourhood of a space curve. Our argument involves elementary Fourier analytic methods, which recover the previous best known result in R3 due to Huang and give new bounds in all higher dimensions. A key ingredient is a variant of a classical oscillatory integral estimate due to Arkhipov-Chubarikov-Karatsuba.</p></div>

    <h4 class="sem-date">November 25, 2025</h4>
<strong>Roope Anttila</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-11-25">Dvoretzky covering problem for general measures on the real line</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-11-25"><p>A random covering set is the set of points covered infinitely often by a random collection of balls with radii given by a predetermined sequence of positive real numbers and centers chosen independently at random with respect to a fixed measure. In 1956, in the context of the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle, Aryeh Dvoretzky posed the following question: When does the random covering set fully cover the support of the measure with probability one? This question was answered in 1972 by Shepp, who showed that, for the Lebesgue measure, a necessary and sufficient condition for full covering is given by the divergence of a certain series which only depends on the sequence of radii. Prior to Shepp's work, a necessary condition for full covering was found by Billard in 1965, and a few years after this, Kahane noticed that this condition, now commonly known in the literature as Billard's condition, easily extends to arbitrary Borel probability measures. In this talk, I will discuss an ongoing joint project with Markus Myllyoja, where we show that Billard's condition is also sufficient for full covering for any Borel probability measure on the real line. If time permits, I will end by discussing an application to the Dvoretzky covering problem on self-conformal sets.</p></div>

<div class="sem-entry">
    <h4 class="sem-date">February  4, 2025</h4>
<strong>Thierry de Pauw</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-02-04">Density estimate from below in relation to a conjecture of A. Zygmund on Lipschitz differentiation</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-02-04"><p>This talk is about a generalisation of the Lebesgue density theorem. With each point x in the plane, we associate a line L(x) containing x and we ask whether, for each Borel-measurable subset A of the plane, the density ratio H<sup>1</sup>(A &cap; B(x,r) &cap; L(x))/2r converges to 1 as r &searr; 0, for a.e. x &isin; A. Here, H<sup>1</sup> is the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The answer depends on the regularity of the mapping L : x &#8614; L(x). If the direction of L is constant, then the answer is positive, according to the Lebesgue density theorem in the real line combined with Fubini's theorem. For some L whose direction is merely continuous, the answer is negative due to the existence of a Nikodym set and, in fact, the above density ratio may vanish for all x &isin; A. I will report on the following progress: if the direction of L is Lipschitz then the superior limit of the above density ratio exceeds 1/4 for a.e. x &isin; A.</p></div>

<strong>Ana de Orellana</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-02-11">Fourier restriction on fractals</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-02-11"><p>We study an extension of the Stein—Tomas restriction theorem using the Fourier spectrum, a family of dimensions that live between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. This leads to an L<sup>p</sup> to L<sup>2</sup> estimate for restriction on multifractals. Joint work with Marc Carnovale and Jonathan Fraser.</p></div>

<strong>Dmytro Karvatskyi</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-02-18">Topological and fractal properties of self-similar sets with integer similarity dimension</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-02-18"><p>We study the topological and fractal properties of self-similar sets on the real line, generated by an IFS with an integer similarity dimension and translations that possess a peculiar combinatorial property. A recent result obtained with O. Makarchuk on the Lebesgue measure of attractors, together with other findings, can help us uncover their topological structure. The most intriguing scenario arises when the attractor has a non-empty interior and a fractal boundary.</p></div>

    <h4 class="sem-date">February 25, 2025</h4>
<strong>Pieter Allaart</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-02-25">Random subsets of self-similar sets</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-02-25"><p>We consider random subsets of self-similar sets generated by a branching random walk with exponentially decreasing steps, or equivalently, via random labelings of the edges of a full infinite M-ary tree. These random subsets can be viewed as statistically self-similar sets with extreme overlaps, hence their almost-sure box-counting and Hausdorff dimensions coincide. We show that the computation of this dimension breaks into three essentially different cases, depending on the parameters of the model. In one case, the random subset has the same dimension as the self-similar set it is part of, although it is almost surely a proper subset. We give precise formulas for the dimension in the other two cases. This is joint work with Lauritz Streck.</p></div>

<strong>Antti Kaemaki</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-03-11">Hausdorff dimension of self-affine sponges with random contractions</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-03-11"><p>We compute the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of random self-affine sponges in R<sup>d</sup> without imposing any separation conditions. In this context, randomness arises from the matrices in the defining semigroup, which are random yet the corresponding affine maps share a fixed point. This setup reveals a novel phenomenon: the almost sure Hausdorff dimension---even in the separated self-similar case---depends on the specific way randomness is introduced into the matrices. This talk presents ongoing research conducted with Balázs Bárány and Michal Rams.</p></div>

<strong>Lijian Yang</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-03-18">Hausdorff Dimensions of Restricted Besicovitch Sets</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-03-18"><p>We investigate a special class of Kakeya sets by considering the collection of midpoints of unit line segments. Given an upper bound on the dimension of this midpoint collection, we establish a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the corresponding Kakeya set. As a corollary, we obtain a result that implies the Kakeya conjecture under certain conditions. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser.</p></div>

<strong>Natalia Jurga</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-03-25">Quantitative equidistribution for dynamical systems</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-03-25"><p>One of the fundamental features of an ergodic  dynamical system (T,X,m) is that for almost every x in X, the sequence of empirical distributions along its orbit converges to the measure m. In this talk we will discuss a quantitative version of this fact and its connection to the fractal properties of the measure m. This is ongoing work with Mike Todd.</p></div>

<strong>Tianyi Feng</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-04-01">Can continuous functions fill up a square?</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-04-01"><p>We investigate the Assouad dimension of graphs of typical functions in Hölder-like spaces, such as the little Hölder space and the space of quasi-Lipschitz functions.

<strong>Kenneth Falconer</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-04-22">Projections, dimensions and capacities - Ancient and modern</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-04-22"><p>Starting with Marstrand's projection theorem I will discuss various results on dimensions of projections of sets, and in particular the use of potential theoretic methods. The talk will have the form of a survey but will include some fairly recent results.</p></div>

<strong>Yunlong Xu</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-04-29">Dimensions of Orbital Sets in Complex Dynamics</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-04-29"><p>We investigate the box dimension of orbital sets in complex dynamics. In particular, we are interested in the relationship between the box dimension of the orbital set and the box dimension of the associated Julia set for any rational map with degree at least 2 defined on Riemann sphere. Joint work with Jonathan Fraser.</p></div>

<strong>Collin Bleak</strong>: <label for="ab-2025-05-06">Embedding certain automatic groups into the rational group R.</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2025-05-06"><p>We introduce left-continuous automatic groups as a subclass of the well-known automatic groups.  The class of left-continuous automatic groups is a bit mysterious as a subclass of the automatic groups, but, we know at least that the class contains the CAT(0) Cubical Complex groups (CCC groups), which themselves represent a broad class of groups of topical interest.  Our main theorem states that all left-continuous automatic groups embed as subgroups of the rational group R, a group introduced in 2000 by Grigorchuk, Nekrashevych, and Suschanskii.  We will provide definitions and examples of these various groups along the way, and have some discussion as well of different forms of boundaries of groups.  We also discuss how similar embedding theorems have been of use in larger programs of discovery.  Joint work with Belk, Chatterji, Matucci and Perego.</p></div>

<strong>Boyuan Zhao</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-09-24">Strongly positive recurrence for countable Markov shifts</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-09-24"><p>A standard approach in the study of dynamical systems is to show the map asymptotically behaves like an independent system hence classical theorems like CLT holds for observables with reasonable regularity. For non-uniformly hyperbolic maps with a countable Markov partition, the system can be studied symbolically via a countable Markov subshift, and we provide a new characterisation of strongly positive recurrence for the CMS which guarantees the exitence of an equilibrium state with the exponential mixing property.</p></div>

<strong>Mike Todd</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-10-01">Multivariate extremes in dynamics</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-10-01"><p>In applications extreme events can occur in different variables and can also influence each other (eg extreme atmospheric pressure and extreme rainfall at the same, or nearly the same, time).  The theory can be interpreted in dynamical context in terms of hitting times to different sets, the interesting cases occurring when hits to one set influence hits to another.  I will present some simple interval maps which exhibit these phenomena - under the bonnet we're using ideas such as copulas, stable dependence functions and Pickands dependence function from Extreme Value Theory.  This is joint work with R Aimino, A.C. Freitas and J.M. Freitas.</p></div>

<strong>Victor Donnay</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-10-08">Surfaces in R<sup>3</sup> with Anosov Geodesic Flow</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-10-08"><p>Geodesic flow on surfaces of negative curvature were the prototypical example of chaotic dynamical systems. Metrics of negative curvature can only be realized on surfaces of genus ≥2 and can never be isometrically embedded in R<sup>3</sup>. In the 1980-90s, metrics were developed with positive curvature on the sphere and torus (and other genus surfaces) that were embeddable for which the geodesic flow was ergodic with positive Lyapunov exponents almost everywhere (non-uniform hyperbolicity). However, these examples were not structurally stable: under a small perturbation one could produce regions of stability and destroy ergodicity. In this talk, we describe joint work with Dan Visscher in which we construct embedded surfaces whose geodesic flow is Anosov: it is both strongly chaotic (ergodic and uniformly hyperbolic) and retains this property under small perturbations of the metric. While there are no known obstructions to such surfaces existing for genus ≥2, our examples have significantly higher genus. In honor of the fractal group at St. Andrews, I will also talk about a community math project my students and I did – creating the world’s largest Sierpinski triangle out of 89,000 K’NEX pieces.</p></div>

<strong>Steve Senger</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-10-15">Point configurations determined by dot products in different settings</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-10-15"><p>A classical problem due to Erdős asks for lower bounds on the number of distinct distances determined by a large finite set of points in the plane. While this was resolved in 2010 by Guth and Katz, the analogous problem for dot products is still wide open. We discuss recent results and barriers to progress for corresponding problems in the settings of finite fields and fractal subsets.</p></div>

<strong>Joseph Feneuil</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-10-29">How to characterize uniformly rectifiable sets with solutions on the complement?</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-10-29"><p>Uniformly rectifiable sets are often viewed as good sets for singular integrals, potential theory, and geometric measure theory. Roughly speaking, those sets have big overlaps with Lipschitz images at every scale. In this talk, I will survey several equivalent characterizations of uniform rectifiability of an Ahlfors regular set and highlight a characterization in terms of oscillation of the Green function for a class of elliptic operators on the complement of the set. In contrast to some earlier characterization of uniform rectifiability via elliptic solutions that are only valid for sets of co-dimension 1, this Green function characterization holds also in the higher co-dimensional setting. This is based on joint works with Guy David, Linhan Li, and Svitlana Mayboroda.</p></div>

In this talk, I will give an overview of these curvature measures before presenting some results due to Steffen Winter and Martina  Zähle which extend these ideas to the fractal setting.

However, this result has several limitations. In this talk, I will discuss improvements and extensions of Pham's result to arbitrary dimensions with general non-degenerate quadratic forms. As a corollary, we generalize sharp results on the Falconer-type problem for quotient sets of distance sets. This is joint work with Alex Iosevich and Doowon Koh.</p></div>

The Furstenberg set problem (solved in 2023 by Ren and Wang) is to determine the smallest possible Hausdorff dimension of an (s,t)-Furstenberg set.

<strong>Saeed Shaabanian</strong>: <label for="ab-2024-11-26">A natural connection between recurrence laws in ϕ-mixing dynamical systems</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2024-11-26"><p>Dynamical systems is the study of how systems behave over time. One of these behaviours is the recurrence of a point to its initial position or to a nearby location. This behaviour can be studied through two laws: hitting time and escape rate. Hitting time is the recurrence law to neighbourhoods which shrink to a point, while the escape rate is the rate at which points escape through a fixed set, thought of as a hole. In this talk, I will discuss the connection between these two laws and how one can transition between them when the system is ϕ-mixing i.e. with the help of a decaying function ϕ, the system, which has been converted to a probability space with a probability measure, asymptotically behaves like an independent process.</p></div>

The name of this equivalence relation is the orbit equivalence relation. The results of these studies directly lead to the diagnosis of entropy of dynamical systems.

The result is a corollary of a uniform scaling property of self-conformal measures: roughly speaking, a measure is said to be uniformly scaling if the sequence of successive magnifications of the measure equidistributes, at almost every point, for a common distribution supported on the space of measures.

A classical example is the <em>Fibonacci substitution</em>, which is composed of the rules <var>a↦ab</var> and <var>b↦a</var>. Random substitutions allow multiple transformation rules for each letter, along with associated probabilities. Associated with a substitution is a shift-invariant ergodic frequency measure, which quantifies the relative occurrence of finite words as subwords of the substitution. Frequency measures are an interesting class of invariant measures which witness a form of self-similarity, while exhibiting complex overlapping phenomena.

In 2010, Freitas, Freitas and Todd linked the study of recurrence properties of a dynamical system to Extreme Value Theory and Point Process theory. In the presence of clustering of extreme events, the problem becomes more interesting and received attention over the subsequent years. In this talk, after a fast-forwarded overview of the theory, we focus on the piling process introduced in the most recent work of Freitas, Freitas and Todd, via some worked out examples. In particular, the existence of such well-defined structure is a requirement for the Enriched Functional Limit Theorems derived in the same paper, however the piling process may on its own provide a new insight to clustering patterns.</p><div class="sem-video">Recording: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bpUesUzJzsw">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bpUesUzJzsw</a></div></div>

One way of classifying aperiodic sets is to study repetition of finite patterns, where sets with patterns repeating linearly often, or linearly repetitive sets, can be viewed as the most ordered aperiodic sets. <br>
<br>

Repetitivity of a cut and project set depends on the slope and shape of the irrational slice. The cross-section of the slice is known as the window. In an earlier work it was shown that for cut and project sets with a cube window, linear repetitivity holds if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) the set has minimal complexity and (ii) the irrational slope satisfies a certain Diophantine condition. In a new joint work with Jamie Walton, we give a generalisation of this result for other polytopal windows, under mild geometric conditions. A key step in the proof is a decomposition of the cut and project scheme, which allows us to make sense of condition (ii) for general polytopal windows.</p><div class="sem-video">Recording: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fmywdP6gsh8">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fmywdP6gsh8</a></div></div>

I will discuss this phenomenon for self-similar iterated function systems in the real line satisfying the weak separation condition, where the multifractal formalism is known not to hold in general.

The main tool I will introduce is a new symbolic encoding of the self-similar set using a weighted directed graph construction, where associated self-similar measures are described by products of non-negative matrices associated with the edges in the graph. A key insight is that, under the weak separation condition, the multifractal formalism is partially characterized by certain properties of the graph itself.</p><div class="sem-video">Recording: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PJa2iJAN2gs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PJa2iJAN2gs</a></div></div>

They arise in turbulent dynamical systems and play an important role in the theory of conformal welding. We introduce elliptical polynomial spirals, a flexible family of planar spirals with differing polynomial rates of decay in the two-axis directions. After setting the scene, we present the various dimensions of these spirals and probe the way they differ via the emerging field of dimension interpolation. Then, we consider the regularity of H&#246;lder maps that deform one spiral into another. Dimension yields an initial bound on the H&#246;lder exponent, which, surprisingly, may be improved upon by analysing the images of spirals under fractional Brownian motion.

Informally speaking, this means that the points of the sequence clump together to the same degree that they would if they had been picked randomly. For example, the sequence of natural numbers does not have MPPC, while the sequence of square numbers does. Generally, if a sequence has too much additive structure, like the natural numbers, then it will not have MPPC. If it has very little additive structure, like the squares or the powers of two, then it will have MPPC. But there is a zone in between "too much" and "very little" additive structure where the picture is not so clear, and there has been a lot of work devoted to finding a threshold separating sequences with MPPC from those without, based on what is called the sequence's "additive energy."

<strong>Nayab Khalid</strong>: <label for="ab-2020-08-04">The rotation distance between two binary rooted trees</label><input type="checkbox" id="ab-2020-08-04"><p>A rotation in a binary tree is a local restructuring of the tree, executed by collapsing an internal edge of the tree to a point, thereby obtaining a node with three children, and then re-expanding the node of order three in the alternative way. The rotation distance between a pair of trees with the same number of nodes is the minimum number of rotations needed to convert one tree into another. There has been a great deal of interest in the problems (initially presented by Culik and Wood in 1982 and Sleater, Tarjan and Thurston in 1988): what is the maximum rotation distance between any pair of n-node binary trees? Is there a polynomial time algorithm (in the number of nodes of the trees) to determine the rotation distance between a given pair of trees?
<br>
<br>
There is a natural link between the rotation distance problem and Thompson's group F, which has been extensively studied. In this talk, I will discuss a remarkable result by Dehornoy (2010) where he explores this link but ultimately leaves an open problem. Time permitting, I will also discuss a result in my PhD thesis which might provide a solution to this open problem.</p><div class="sem-video">Recording: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HSiPnAQj6Vs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HSiPnAQj6Vs</a></div></div>

The concept was formally raised by Bernard Derrida and Martin Retaux in 2014, as a toy model for the longstanding Poland-Scheraga model of DNA transition. 

An example would be the initial distribution <i>X</i><sup> 0</sup> which takes value 0 with probability 1-<i>p</i> and takes value 2 with probability <i>p</i>. The iteration relationship is that <i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i>+1</sup> = (<i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>+<i>Y</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>-1)<sup>+</sup> (where (<i>a</i>)<sup>+</sup> = max{<i>a</i>,0}), where <i>Y</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup> is i.i.d with <i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>.

The free energy is defined to be the limit of &#120124;(<i>X</i><sup> <i>n</i></sup>)/2<sup><i>n</i></sup>. There exists a critical value <i>p<sub>c</sub></i> such that when <i>p &lt; p<sub>c</sub></i> the free energy is 0, but when <i>p &gt; p<sub>c</sub></i> the free energy is positive. 
<br>
<br>
Surprisingly in 1984, Collect, Eckmann, etc. discovered a precise formula to calculate <i>p<sub>c</sub></i> when the initial distribution is integer-valued from the viewpoint of real dynamics. In this talk I will mainly present a 'surprising' result in my undergraduate thesis: their formula holds if and only if the initial distribution is integer-valued. I will also talk about a recent breakthrough on the phase transition order by Shi, etc. (2019).</p><div class="sem-video">Recording: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zsjyj0p234I">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zsjyj0p234I</a></div></div>

Marstrand's 1954 projection theorem regarding orthogonal projections of Borel sets in the plane, and Furstenberg's sumset conjecture, regarding sumsets of sets invariant under T<sub>2</sub>(x)=2x mod1 and T<sub>3</sub>(x)=3x mod1. Hochman and Shmerkin's breakthrough paper in 2012 provided both a strengthening of Marstrand's projection theorem for self-similar sets with irrational rotations, and a full resolution of Furstenberg's sumset conjecture. The key to both proofs is the method of CP-chains, a theory devised by Furstenberg himself and developed by Hochman and Shmerkin to tackle problems in fractal geometry and geometric measure theory. We will discuss this method and some of the numerous results it has helped to prove in recent years.</p></div>

If two automorphisms are not conjugate, then in finite time you can detect this using the `gyration' and `sign' vectors (infinite vectors generated from the automorphisms taking values, in the first case, in Z/nZ in the nth coordinate, and in the second case,  in Z/2Z in each coordinate).  However, while these invariants can be constructed from given automorphisms, finding an automorphism with given invariance vectors is not an easy task (and in general, one cannot just pick any two vectors).  

  Boyle has proposed the following question: Consider the full (one-sided) shift on n-letters.  Does there exists an automorphism A of order n acting freely on the shift space (every point has an orbit of length n under the action of the automorphism), but where A is not conjugate to a permutation on n letters?  We will discuss these invariants, and then, give an automorphism of the sort in Boyle's question.  Joint with Feyisayo Olukoya.</p></div>

The result that will be presented in this talk states that a typical fractal percolation set E intersects every set which is winning for a certain game that is called the "hyperplane absolute game", and the intersection has the same Hausdorff dimension as E. An example of such a winning set is the set of badly approximable vectors in dimension d. <br>
In order to prove this theorem one may show that a typical fractal percolation set E contains a sequence of Ahlfors-regular subsets with dimensions approaching the dimension of E, where all the subsets in this sequence are also "hyperplane diffuse", which means that they are not concentrated around affine hyperplanes when viewed in small enough scales. <br>

It is well known that sets of positive Lebesgue measure contain a homothetic copy of every finite pattern. We will see that Hausdorff measure (and Hausdorff dimension) cannot be used to detect existence or nonexistence of patterns inside sets. So, if we want to guarantee the presence of patterns in a set, we need a different notion of size. I will talk about a work in progress in which I guarantee the presence of certain patterns in sets of large thickness. This two concepts had not been connected until now. The proof is simple and it is based on variants of Schmidt's game. I will also share some questions with you.</p></div>

In this regard, there is a well-known theorem of Kapovich and Benakli that a hyperbolic group acts with finite kernel on its visual boundary. In our talk, we analyse this action to discover that the action can actually be modelled by specialised finite state automata called transducers.

Fixing a hole and considering the exponential rate of escape of mass through it as time goes to infinity will result in a degenerate limit if the mixing is too slow for the hole size (i.e. slow exponential, or even subexponential).  Shrinking the hole linearly with time (Hitting Time Statistics) gives non-degenerate limit laws in all known mixing cases.  I’ll discuss a general framework for these limits and show how they can detect mixing rates.  This is joint work with Henk Bruin and Mark Demers.</p></div>

any pair of scales <em>0 &lt; r &lt; R</em>, any ball of radius <em>R</em> may be covered by a constant times <em>(R/r)<sup>\(\alpha\)</sup></em> balls of radius <em>r</em>.  We introduce a spectrum 
of dimensions, motivated by the Assouad dimension, designed to get more information about the scaling structure of the space. More precisely, 
to each <em>\(\theta\) &isin; (0,1)</em>, we associate the appropriate analogue of the Assouad dimension with the restriction that the two scales <em>r</em> and <em>R </em>
used in the definition satisfy <em>log R/ log r=\(\theta\)</em>.  We conduct a detailed study of the resulting `dimension spectrum' (as a function of 
<em>\(\theta\)</em>) including its basic analytic and geometric properties as well as the precise calculation of the spectrum for some specific examples.

A natural question to ask now is whether or not it is possible to "smooth" out this erratic behaviour by taking averages of the box counting function. It transpires that in fact no such "smoothing" is possible using general averaging methods, and indeed the nth order average box dimensions of a typical continuous function are as different as possible.
